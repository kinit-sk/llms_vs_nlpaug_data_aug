dont waste your time  we had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck one of them the owner  both times we never heard from them  not a call not the estimate nothing,0
wast there last friday seats right in front if the stage the show was good the headliner while a bit long was good fantastic service from our waitresses will definitely go back,3
great barnes and noble location and they have plenty of books thatll help you pass the time,2
i hate this placenits very loud the service is very poor and the food is sosonif you want good chinese in pittsburgh try china palace shadyside or sesame inn station square or north hills  theyre quieter with very good food  service,0
this is by far my favorite panera location in the pittsburgh area friendly plenty of room to sit and good quality food  coffee panera is a great place to hang out and read the news  they even have free wifi try their toasted sandwiches especially the chicken bacon dijon,4
very very good chain family restaurant i had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great service was excellent and the party of 5 i was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse its hard for me to give a chain 55 but this is pretty close,3
good one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh went yesterday with family and enjoyed oystersvery fresh i always like appetizers more than their entrees,3
this place is amazing jim is a great artist traveled all the way from tampa just to get my tattoo i would recommend this place to everyone,4
this cafes espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere  i always go out of my way to get coffee from here when im in pittsburgh,4
wings are overpriced and the quality of them are bad they were tough and greasy the staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar,1
the decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good and fresh ive gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet both good for the price  its inexpensive,3
right by my house spicy peanut and cheesy snake are amazing,3
love this place the decor inside is really coolnnim not from the area but i try to stop in every time im traveling through so many great veg options and great drinks,3
its cheap ill say that but otherwise its bland food served by workers who mostly dont seem to notice theyre working and when they do only respond snarkily there are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from,0
our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes weve been for breakfast lunch and dinner and everything weve gotten has been incredibly delicious love this place,4
refused to take my cat which had passed away for cremation cause i had not been to the clinic previously imho thats ridiculous i will not recommended anyone to ever come here,0
the products and service are great but the prices are outrageousnni am on a vegan diet and have found this coop really helpful if you can get past the prices the selection is great,2
for 30 bucks a month this is a pretty rad spot ive climbed all over the us and canada but im happy to call this my home gym,3
service was okay at best i wouldnt go there again  they quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection  i took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote,1
maybe i went on a bad night but the service was stunningly bad  water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes  ordered 5 dishes all pretty average  the tab  300  i wont be back,1
i am a big fan of maxs for their local flair real german food and authentic pittsburgh feeling they did not sell out are not overly commercialized and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city thanks maxs,4
this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket ive ever been to there are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot the interior is dark and dank and has an outdated made in the 70s feel with options like this i dont have a problem taking the extra time to drive to trader joes,0
still the best and for me the only professional football team in the world,4
this conservative pos rag makes faux news look like npr you got scaife himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running no one reads it the post gazette is the real newspaper in this city,0
nicks used to be good with the previous owner that all changed which is pretty sad,0
nicks has legit new york style pizza  its dirt cheap too,3
people and company make mistakes nthe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem nnthis shows they care about their customers and value the business,3
tasty,2
another ugly haircut like everywhere in pittsburgh for 60 with the owner trusted the reviews but now look like a pittsburgh redneck no hair on the sides and long on the back,1
had lunch with my wife the quality of the sushi was quite good my wife had some tempura that was fabulous service was friendly and quick we really enjoyed our lunch we will be back,3
excellent and made from scratch,4
this was just bad pizza  for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza  the cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out  also the mushrooms were out of a can  do not waste money here,0
terrible place to eat and not very clean at all way over priced foe fast food 5 for a plain roast beef forget that,0
sadly really went downhill they switched to a new vendor the prices went up and they are no longer having sales,0
the pizza is great other food items might disappoint they do deliver service is hit and miss there is one rude  smileless bartender i have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because i was in the mood for good service,2
what a place what a selection  i love it  nnthis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world  you can buy mixed six packs as well nnthe food is great and service is just fine,4
much nicer since the renovation the only thing i dont love is that there are rarely baskets near the entrance and its weird how you have to go through the whole produce area to get to the rest of the storenncheckers are usually friendly here and good selection and variety,3
this location has such a different feel than the others around pittsburgh perhaps its the welllit bar or maybe its that theres a new bartender every time i make it over here in any case it doesnt quite have the feel that north hills and robinson have,2
grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work  man they dont last long  bagels are good and the service is friendly  they were real busy but make time to chat will working,2
a good starbucks  there is always a line at this one due to its location but they do a great job of getting people served quickly  today i had a salted camel mocha  it was pretty amazingnnthis location also has a fireplace which is a nice touch for cold days,3
i always had a good experience eating here for lunch  yea it is a bit run down but name some in the strip that arent  they have 500 lunch specials and jimmy was always very nice and the huge stogies in his mouth just took me back  funny highly recommend,4
awfulnnever ever follows schedule lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min,0
how is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway but cant update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work had to call off it was just to cold out,0
there was basically no cheese on my cheese combo sandwich the fries were gross and the waitress was nasty to us,0
bread slaw tomato fries and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together warm yiengling and mediocre service   aweful,1
i love this place i eat here anytime i go downtown for anything always get the gyro with extra meat and sauce so amazing yum,4
not the best ever but pretty decent stuff  a slice for 250 in downtown ill be back,2
ewww the food here is terrible  nothing i had tasted good  it tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours  the service is luke warm at best  just skip it  theres so many other places out there for good italian food,0
wonderful experience,4
i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years  marjorie is amazing and priceless  i am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor  i travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel  wouldnt go anywhere else,4
the selection is pretty vast  european upscale specialty brands up to 24 for a 3 oz bar bulk malt balls in 3 flavors that are wonderful housebrand hot chocolate mix and lots more its fun just to browse around and know all these choices exist,3
i have seen a lot of shows here  its really nice and brings some amazing productions to the city  nnand i also saw the great gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned,3
this is the worst chinese food ive had ever and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places  the golden palace buffet is bad but at least edible  i am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business,0
this place is great we purchased the smoked prosciutto hard salami and peperoni when we stopped in the counter staff was very friendly despite being very busy and made some excellent recommendations nnnext time im going to add a selection of cheeses to my purchase of cured meat,3
prefab fried food decor has character the beer is cheap,1
awesome chowder but thats it,1
update  went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best  so disappointing we loved it the first time  my guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven youre good to go  otherwise youre sol,1
i am in town for work and i decided to order food from here the food was awesome i ordered the peoples special biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room i will definitely order from here again the next time im in town,4
530pm worst baingan bartha ive ever had unfresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat please invest in fresh chillies they keep well and will make that 8 really pop with flavor,0
pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls they dont even serve it with the lettuce and herbs you can get in pittsburgh on the flip side though their owner is super friendly,2
i am from houston since i came here ive been searching for the perfect bowl of pho i have to say this is the closest thing yet from home good pho with fair pricing doesnt get ebtter than this,3
the food isnt something to rave about but its edible i love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves i have only been to critters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when pittsburghs finest come out to play never a dull moment,1
flies in this place,0
friendly service fresh veggies at only 1 dollar a person for byob and no corkage this place is a steal the price is right too nnif you are a veggie curry wine lover who loves family style friendly service then this place is for you,4
yes the pizza is the best in the burgh  but dont dont forget the wings  they also have the best wings in the burgh  they dont deliver  they dont have to  id drive for miles,4
other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends i didnt like nor dislike this place it was quite small and looked dirty the pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol nit wasnt horrible,2
the sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car i always wanted for a price i could afford  talk to jeff and dom they are awesome,4
never ever get the allyoucaneat hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isnt even grilled they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi its like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly also service was unfriendly,0
this place has been on my list since i became a foodie quotes intended  and finally i was in town with the flexibility to gonnits worth it  i think its on par with pizzeria bianco and pupatellas as as good as it gets for me  and the great pastas and apps solidified the five star ratingnnvery great,4
not quite as good as the squirrel hill location but quick service would recommend the sicilian pizza over the usual style,2
not a huge fan of their coffee the cookies and pastries are really good however the lemonade is amazing the lady who works their is super rude and never smiles the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers,1
this is a fantastic small hair salon i have been going here for years and they are experts you always feel valued and always have great service and a great cut toonthe ambiance is superb small quaint and not full of egos that you would normally find at a salon of this calibernni highly recommend,4
cute place with a delicious cap perfectly proportionate,3
excellent food they did a great job with the renovation the place is swank,4
not my cup of tea i did not like my tuna entree despite it being somewhere around 35 nni do enjoy their cocktails and like to come to the bar for happy hour,2
consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance what more could you ask for oh yes excellent wine list and drinks,4
best sushi in pittsburgh small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase like the tatami mat seating as well,4
two words frozen cosmosnnyou need no other motivation to go to harris although the food and service is good too,3
harris grill i think  your menu is trying too hardnnfirst place i went on my visit to pittsburgh  menu was a little overly silly waitress was a little underly friendlyhelpfultimely and food while decent was overpriced for the qualitynni may be back to pittsburgh but wont be back to harris grill,1
very good short rib tacos long wait for food though,3
i just got my hair done at dean of shadyside salon with valerie my cut was amazing she listened to what i wanted out of my hair cut and gave me advice on what i should do to achieve the look i wanted as well ni was so excited about my cut i rebooked for cut and color,4
typical sports bar with great wings kitchen sink wings were 50 each the night we went the fried zucchini was great as well more breading then zucchini but it doesnt matter after a few beers we also tried the nachos and tater tots which were fine service was great they also have daily beer specials,2
id give this joint zero stars if it was possible  this is the worst spot on walnut st  im not even sure where to start the bar is small and overpriced i had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved  the vegetables werent even cooked this is a place no one wants toor should ever want to go,0
didnt havana go out of biz i think this is the place with the purple awning if not oops this place is ok it does have a swanky feel and the martinis are ok but overall it is nothing special usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on ellsworth,1
platinum blonde perfection  jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde do ever  it was gorgeous  my hair looked like corn silk  if i had boatloads of money id fly him out to la every 6 weeks for a touch up   go to see jaytell him laura from la sent you,4
i do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that i want but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items and the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him he can help you a lot,3
their appetizers are very very good i also like their daily menu fresh stuff and high quality ingredients the salad that comes with any entree is awesome overall excellent i go there regularly it usually gets very crowded though so plan ahead,4
definitely a great place to go if youve had a long night of drinking they even have a special called the morning after breakfast i found the food greasy and the pancakes i wish they had a more regular style but its a great place to meet up and catch up with friends it is cashonly btw,2
great hotcakes no so great wait  the hotcakes are worth trying but there are other places in pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that i prefer,2
good food cooked well came out hot service was also very good waitress came back to top off coffees more than once prices also good but cash only wouldnt wait if a really long line but definitely would go early to get a better than average breakfast out,3
nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great cafe au lait  they have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones  they could add a couple more savory ones but otherwise i would definitely eat there again,3
cash only we love their crepes i dont like latta that much it is good experience,3
cash only cute place good crepes good coffee,3
i love their vegan  vegetarian menu the food is so good just remember to ask them to hold the msg nnfriendly service clean nice atmosphere,4
the owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it,0
good food  quick delivery  caution  the 200 delivery charge is not listed on the menu  surpriseits listed on your bill  caution   a tad pricey  oh yeahi live in pittsburgh now,2
always had great food try the clam chowder,3
i love new china the service is always fast and fresh the sweet tea is amazing yes chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can beat new china in belmont,4
they do take out and delivery the pizza is tastier than most delivery places the 10 is a good size for an individual pizza the staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had we will definitely be getting food from them again,3
very good classic new york pizza i would highly recommend it if you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce they tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place,3
i am a fan of the beer selection and beer selection only they have a great mix of really good german beer and seem to rotate it seasonally as for the food its not fair for me to comment i just dont care for german cuisine,3
closed and has been for a long time now  last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more  an average steakhouse,1
i used to be in the industry and i know what my car does and does not need  they couldnt seem to get that and kept trying to sell me crap  overpriced slow very dirty and an overall sketchy vibe,0
first class everything  service incredible great hidden gem in the heart of charlotte  i recommend staying,4
authentic irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere expected selection of draft beers for an irish pub good selection of bottled beers,3
lights too low music too loud not many people inside drinks too expensive plus it costs 5 just to get in def not worth it try some where else,0
i only gave them 1 star because 0 wasnt an option food was mediocre fries were cold and we havent seen our waitress in 45 minutes writing this review while waiting to ask for the check ill write another review tomorrow if im still here waiting,0
not thrilling not disappointing  rb is average across the board  try the hazelnut crusted chicken,2
one extra star because they are consistent well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and asian,3
ok but not fabulousdecor in room was bland  quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free  great view of uptown and very comfortable beds,2
a few of us went here for lunch on a friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive   nni had the blue petit mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch,1
ive eaten at merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink very impressed my favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times overall nice place to eat,3
i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty  just didnt care for it,1
had dinner last night here the food left a lot to be desired reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough really disappointing ive been here before when i come to charlotte and had better food hopefully this was a oneoff,1
only went there during happy hour there was a great drink selection but it was so crowded the service was not great,2
i had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted the staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great thank you so very much i shall keep coming back come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world,4
even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad ive eaten here and at the one in south end and both are a waste  i usually just eat at the pita pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendorsthe chicken on a stick is might damn good by the forum,1
the two stars are for one thing the slice  it is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking  other than that this place is grimy creepy and nasty  i would suggest trying one of the other fuels outside of the city trust me  nnian m,1
the steak was cooked to perfection    staff  is very friendly nice place to hang out,4
a well kept secret if you are looking for wine treats you have to check this out it is like a little wine store located right inside the department store they do tastings and classes and have a special room for the fine stuff i have only just peeked through the glass but yum,4
great turkey grinder,3
the arthurs menu offers a wide variety of options including burgers sandwiches wraps soup salad  grindersplus wine desserts  other treatsna great spot found in southpark mall to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier,3
drink prices are high but the dancing is fun,2
this place is fun because it is on the light rail line   things here do tend to be expensive but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died,3
dont eat anything but the chicken everything else is nasty charlotte should be a bbq mecca it isnt because of the chains go back to florida they like it there,1
ride the intimidator some say to visit the great wall of china before you diei say tide the intimidator,3
small park over priced food we paid 55 for 3 slices of pizza  2 orders of chicken wings that were the smallest flavorless wings we have ever had and 2 beersnever againpack food,2
its carowinds some good rides most surrounded by stuff you wont ride or games you wont waste money on the kids will have fun no doubt the people are nice enough the group hospitality is very good with great brisket and chicken they make you feel welcome just enjoy it,2
crime is a problem  i had my phone and keys stolen from me while i was in the pool at dowd  my babysitter had her car broken into in the dowd parking lot as well both of these events took place within the last 2 months  it is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe,0
this ymca is very large  it has 4 floors to exercise  like 10 racket ball rooms  towel and rags are ease of access to shower and etc  the downside is that most hours of the day it is crowded because it is located downtown,3
i went on a saturday at lunch not very busy  friday i went by for lunch and it was busy with the downtown office people service and food was great got the dragon and volcano rolls very good and tasty fried dumplings if i ever find myself in charlotte again i will return,3
ive come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal  the food is b asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid  for a quick tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby this a very good choice,3
solid sake menu and the staff was helpful in deciding which one to go with sushi rolls had an interesting spin but nothing out of the ordinary,2
food was terrible service was ok we were told it would be a 3045 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait totally not worth it,0
one of my favorites  the food and service are always excellent   whatever you have ending with the bread pudding not listed on the menu and the tiramisu are a must,3
horrible customer service unless you are into horror movies or the simpsons the people working the counter cant give you a honest review however they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap cant wait to go back,1
ive been going to the visulite since it opened  its my favorite live music venue in charlotte  so many great bands have hit this stage  most of the staff have worked here since the beginning  great atmosphere  many wonderful memories,4
best sushi i have had in charlotte,4
delicious good service one of our favorites places to eatnnhighly recommend the sesame tofu  it is some of the best tofu ive ever had at a restaurant,3
they serve the best roti canai must eat highly recommendeddddddddddddddddddddddddd,4
i have ordered hot subs and for some reason they dont understand that not everyone wants white american i gave them two chances and they havent gotten it right yet i will go to sub station across the street from now on,0
my man does it again  have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor  he has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly and repeatedly deliver quality work  highly recommend,4
nothing special  went during winter and while they still served frozen yogurt i didnt get a chance to try it  the rest of the foods were basic concessionstand items  burgers hot dogs fries onion rings etc  would probably be nice for a visit in the summer but not exactly a lunch destination,2
decent food  no desire to go back for a second try  salad was good but the fried chicken is very bland  i dont know why the place is supposedly known for fried chicken but it does not even break my top 10 for fried chicken  im from the south and know fried chicken  it was tender but very very bland,2
now ive never been to new orleans but i love this place its perfect for my boyfriend and i to go we love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters i would recommend the hurricane drink so good nnthe service is always good and friendly,3
one oft favorite joints in charlotte between the jazz band etoufee and shrimp grits this place takes the cake,4
what a pleasant surprise the fried oysters are the best ever and so is the diane i had it with the crawfish and shrimp even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple definitely a great value my family and i will be returning,4
the fried oysters are to die fornnthe crayfish scampi looks great but a bit too garlickynnthe bbq shrimp is just aoknnreal cool how they turned an old house into cq,2
the have some of the best ribs and rib tips in charlotte tea and lemonade made fresh,4
all i have to say is hayley is very talented i had a great experience here you may need to be patient i took me about 3 months to get in to see her but was well worth the wait,4
wonderful food and shopping available but why does the restroom have a valet in it taking tips  this isnt a european nightclub,2
i was at this airport for a few mins as i connected would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at lax was delayed for no reason,2
charlotte and ready for boarding,1
basically the totally opposite of newark liberty airportnnclean and welllit friendly and courteous tsa members and fast and efficient layout and service,3
huge airport  clean and lots of shopping,2
one of the best us airways hub airports,2
this is what a nyc airport should look like its nchic and they have a wine bar why would a north carolina airport have a nchic wine bar i thought i would land at a crappy run down airport like laguardia airport but to my surprise the south is more modern than nyc odd nyc get with it,3
they are in the middle of revamping the parking near the terminals  easy peasy airport  the food options are lacking but i imagine they will fix that eventually  how about some of that well known nc bbq in the terminals,2
decent airport but it is always a mass of humanity  be sure to stay in your seat if you get one because you will lose it,3
its an airport small but had what it needed planes,2
standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider webs,2
i have never been to an airport before where i would want to come back and just hang out get my nails done check superb southern food check legit shopping check and check,4
went there 6 in the morning its just like any mcdonalds you should know what they serve the staff is very friendly and helpful,3
i cant anymore its too busy here and service is not as fast as other mickey ds with this kind of volume customers are rude too,0
not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have  the sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said the neighborhood is suspect  service was good and i liked the potato salad  baked beans were from the can  drive up was good and service was super fast,1
let me tell you gents this place is totes av average really not much to say if you like food youll probably be able to eat some of it here my friends at the table insist that i rate this place as good average but that seems meaningless also 2 beers of which ive had about 6,1
this place is as bland as they get the food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too,1
i gave up on monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today i felt like mexican for lunch clean great service and the food was very good one of the best quesadillas ive had and the dos equis draft wasnt bad either,3
i visit often  love the white salsa great food good prices,3
it seems a rarity to find a japanese restaurant owned and operated by japanese well musashi is one such place the menu is not the americanized and that is worth three stars alone good authentic menu service and food,3
after having a bad experience and informing the management dean and deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market  way to go,2
this has always been awesome place on my list of places to shop or have a sandwich went recently and had a fantastic lunch,4
my husband and i went grocery shopping here on a  monday evening bad idea the shelves were almost bare and what was left was a mess and disorganized this is unusual for this store which i usually shop at positive for this trip was as usual the salad bar and the tomato bisque soup a must try,2
delicious chinese food  i had the trio of shrimp scallops  chicken and all food was very fresh and wasnt salty like other chinese restaurants  the servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back,4
wish it had been better when i made my one and only trip  the menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me  but i know others have enjoyed it very much maybe i am an exception  i like the wine suggestion it was top notch  staff was efficient and friendly,2
thought wed try showmars they are convenient you place order at the counter and then find a table plenty tables available but every one was sticky i dont consider a table top that holds on to you to be clean nnfood was served quickly and is okay nothing slid off the table,2
a very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff,0
i always come here after playing a round of par 3 golf next door  how can you go wrong with hundreds of beers pretty girls and descent bar food  you cant  cool spot  check it out,3
good food and drinks before going to a concert at the verizon wireless amphitheatre up the street cheers,3
friendliest employees ever and those hamburgers are fantastic  food quality is what id expect at a good sitdown restaurant,4
i had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips both were completely flavorless my husband and i both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions  the tzatziki sauce was okay same with the greek salad,1
visiting friends in nc and we stopped here for breakfast at first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in they got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error the food was okay for the items that we got,2
great specials averaging around 7  the portions are extra large  large seating area  this is your typical quick japanese style stir fry  teriyaki and hibachi stuff   one thing that sucks  no egg rolls  wtf,2
awful awful awful  i have never experienced such rude nurses or doctor in my life i will never go back here again im not sure how they have received positive reviews,0
session key,3
this place never disappoints me tough to get in reservations are a must but always delicious,4
we eat at trio nearly twice a week the menu has various different items and everything is good i love the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die for trio is also very inexpensive for the quality of food that you get most dishes are under 1200 the service is good as well,4
casual dinner with members tonight and food was great service was inexperienced  always love the location and people,2
they have awesome iced thai tea  if you havent tried one then you should go get one love their dishes which are delish and you should tried the fried duck  i dont remember the name just the details theyre yummy too and their staffs are nice too so it a great place to go when you want any thai foods,4
the atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive  the service is above average  the lunch specials are quite appealing and the food itself is pretty tasty,2
i went to salsascabos for the sunday brunch buffet  the freshmade tortillas were wonderful and the service was excellent but the food was just ok for me   there was a good selection of items and everything was tasty but some items were a bit too salty for my taste   i may give it another try,2
like kb said its pretty standard mexican food  i thought the salsa before the meal was too watery  i had the fish tacos  the fish was fried  this place is ok if your in the area and hungry  you wont be thrilled or disappointed,2
i havent been back here in years the food is mediocre at best head to monterreys,1
restaurant is closed,0
i liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email,2
good subs and cheesesteaks slammed at lunch clean plentiful parking,3
just went for sushi superman roll was good overall i would prefer pisces or ru sans but this place was nearby and it did the job service was also good although it wasnt busy at the time,2
terrible ugly du00e9cor bad food poor service,0
the worst macaroni grill ive ever been to  do not waste your time,0
probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad ive had in a long time our other sandwiches were just as disappointing just another chain food restaurant i long for a real deli in charlotte,0
surprisingly the chocolate chip cookie was deliciousnngrilled chicken salad  good enoughnnspud max  great i would definitely get this again  the spud max includes bacon cheddar cheese scallions and ham  add sour cream and i am in heaven,3
i dont even have the words  dont even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but i have to call every 20 min wondering where it is,0
this has been a great experience for my kids sean and his staff are amazing cant say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids,4
i made it to the top thats all that mattersnnlove this place,3

great little place just across the border  food is always great as well as service,3
food was very good i had the reuben sandwich my only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything otherwise i recommend it,3
any place thats located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me its packed on friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table the wait is worth it dont hesitate to try this place out you wont be disappointed,4
for being surrounded by two lakes madison doesnt do a great job of having places to drink on the water head down to mcfarland and check out the beach house its like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake tons of windows not a bad placenncant comment on the food drink specials were solid,3

corp store on lien rd was not a good choice  the manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone if you want good service with people who actually care go to the store on university ave,0
terrible selection of shoes and jeans and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop if you absolutely must visit a department store drive a few miles and hit up macys instead,0
worst security at any venue i have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks 9 for a double fuck that noise security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door ive been through airports with hassle,0
grade cnnchain food okay service i cant explain why i dont hate this place,2
its a national chain so you pretty much get what youd expect i have never had problems with the service and the food is always good,3

neighborhood delivery and takeout greatcertainly a step higher than the other chains in this levelnthey dont biast 30,3
friendly staff and quick service but unfortunately they couldnt make up for the unappetizing dining room and bland food  ill  be shopping around for another chinese place,1
i like montys foodbreakfast lunch and dinner are all very goodbut i just cant help thinking that its overpriced when i go there  it seems like it should be dinerpriced    but almost 9 for a grilled cheese seems a bit steep to me  their desserts are to die for though,2
yucky greasy food,0
sweet potato hash is fantastic  the tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans  in fact their veg dishes are just plain good service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious,3
slightly lower than average hampton inn  heatac wasnt updated pretty typical besides that,2
i love the ohio  its the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing like a virgin on karaoke night and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fightsnnclassy,2
n e w   s e a t s   the old bench were terrible and kept us away  we spent two games this year and we are hooked,4
really beautiful place must go see  herb garden  touch n feel was really good otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event thai garden was also good,4
pretty impressive landscaping floral and fauna display free admission but i suggest spending the extra 2 and visit the conservatory whi check has butterflies and a few birds,3
grease running down my hand thats a first maybe thats appealing to some people but definitely not mennsorry pizza pit staff nncue the tim  eric ya blew it gif,0

grade dnnyeah i order my martinis served on the rocks and in goblets duh,1
the korean tacos are not half bad and the kid really likes the burgers,2
best bbq in madison  hands down  only loses a star for consistently messing up takeout orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south,3
the ribs you must try them my major mistake was getting a 13 slab,4
worst service ever  no one cares was lied to wasted my time twice and ended up demanding a refund and taking business elsewhere  never again,0

the goodnlots of local foodndelicious premade food optionsnpretty decent bakerynnthe badnnot a lot of options for staplesna little hard to navigatennthe uglynprice are sometimes just too high for my taste,2
this location used to be an absolute hole  they recently renovated both the interior and the exterior and now its a very pleasant goodlooking storennhowever its still wendys food  and thats only okay,2
sloooooowwwwwwwww couldnt believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food,0
typical burger and beer place  food is pretty good  service was great,2
wouldnt do an oil change when i came in at 510 the guy at the desk said they didnt have time to do it but they only had one car in the bay whats the point in advertising a cheap special on oil changes if you wont do it because you close only an hour after people get off work,1
the best fast food i know of maybe chipotle as well staff is always friendly im not from here but this place is very wisconsiny to me in a food waynngood chili,2
mediocre sushi that is priced above what it should be at,2
great bread  but i wish the sandwiches were a little bigger  i got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quicklyleft me hungry  i guess ill try the french bread next time  maybe its a little bigger,1
stopped here on our way back form florida not much to choose from out herenni tried the shrimp  grits awesome  never thought  this would be a good combo but it works here nand try the crustless coconut cream pie mmmmngood attentive service,3
mtd is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty  however the buses are often late so be sure to choose a bus that arrives to your destination a few minutes early  at least the mtd buses are free to students,2
cant go wrong with brothers large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game not as good as the iowa location but worth checking out,2
i would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice the naan is really great too i also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer as well as the samosas i am not an expert on indian food so i cant tell you how authentic it is but i can tell you that it is delicious,4
generally okay place a little overpriced for the settings  noisy and place is too small not looking very neat food portion is below average maybe not again,2
boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just bc they were making illegal copies no one should pay 150 for 100 pages of paper,1
called from marketplace mall area when i told the girl on the phone she said that i was serviced by a different location and that they were closed  then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye  wow no effort to satisfy a customer at all,0
i really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible i tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well never go here they have the worst food in entire urbanachampaign area,0
ugh a curry dish with barely any veggies no potatoes do not count theyre not green even some basil in this socalled  basil thai restaurant would have been nice curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor however given a choice why go and have bad food,0
went with a friend and got a bento box salmon teriyaki  food was good but the place is a bit far from campus  im not a fan of miso soup but the rest of my meal was good,2
overpriced just okay italian food  my dinner included overcooked mushy pasta and overcooked shrimphusbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections  not worth the 50 price tagshould have ate at a local joint,1
im not the hugest fan of indian food but if i had to eat it this is where i would go they also have a few other dishes besides indian which is nice the food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic  a lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd,2
easy to schedule and they are the few shops thats open at weekends ntheir 50 special of oil change tire rotation and wiper change is a good deal other than that its pretty similar to other shops nlong wait sometimes an hour wait for an oil change,2
this is a great store  the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable   they have a great selection of fish and supplies as well as miceferretsbirdsreptilesand hermit crabs  if you have a problem with your tank they will test your water and tell you how to fix it,4
three stars for the food and an extra for the great margaritasnnfoodwise i left full but dont remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt but the service i had was goodnntheyve got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes and the mix was pretty good too,3
i got sams french toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill i think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it wouldve been better friendly service though,1
id say this place is pretty hipsternnot just alternative like all the edgy people you can muster in cu come here  it has a real hipster attitudennbut i still love itnall the beers all the liquornthe excellent beer gardennthe good tunesnthe creepy room upstairs for showsnncheers,3
very good soup and fish dishes,3
daily special number 1 is the way to go it comes with half a mackerel and a decent bowl of tofu soup the mackerel can be dry at times though the kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too,3
we try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town  be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also a quaint illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and  easy access a pay parking lot is right next door,2
ok beer selection ok bar food though i am a bit of a beerfood snob  i dont mind going when a group wants to go but not my first choice if im out on my own,2
this guy really knows what he is doing  i always feel better when i leave,4
so many lovely memories of going here twice a week at least with my boynnwe would order strictly from the korean menuif memory serves me right intestine shaped like squirrel anyonennexcellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment,4
nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people,2
great atmosphere delicious coffee awesome food this is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon it can get a little crowded at times thoughnnthe thai tempeh sandwhich is amazing also try the cold brew coffee sometime,4
wanted thai while on champaign for work tried this place and it was good but very small portions so much so that i had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later,2
i really dont get what the big deal is with this place  i have had friends tell me thats they have some of the best burgers out there but when i went there they were nothing special  the place as a whole is just average the setting the service and the food  this place is over rated,1
ive had good luck selling stuff here but none when it comes to buying things i just feel like everything here is either tacky terribly made or just an old trend i definitely have better luck at tj maxx for sure,2
i probably would have given moonstruck threeish stars when it was open but i cant give it any stars any more because its closed  that seemed kind of sudden  i wonder what happened  what is going to go in there instead  panera pleeeaaasssseeeee,0
this place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls  not worth it,0
omg their cookies are delicious i had the peanut butter cookie awesome rice krispy treat delicious ice cream sandwich okay  the sugar cookie pretty goodnnthey do accept credit cards but only on orders that are 5 or more,3
the service is rude here they are impersonal and impolite the food is ok nothing outstanding but not horrible they have really good crab ragoons and their jjajangmyeon is the best youll find in champaign in short food is decent but service is horrible,1
excellent pizza full disclosure i was a cook here and decent beer selection the pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time  the bar space is too long and not wide enough however if you like pool these are very good tables,3
worth the half off tues guys real cheese in those shakers nuff said,3
i am from dallas and in champaign for business  i looked at yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and bacaro seemed to be the place to go  i thought it was great  unique tasty dishes,4
i love this place  my friends and i try to have a girls night out once a month and we frequent radio maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere  it is relaxing and has several conversation pieces  the service is spectacular  this is one of my favorite local spots to dine in champaign,3
by far our favorite spot weve eaten at so far in champaign our server was a little strange  definitely new to the job  but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable very large beer selection as well highly recommend  well be back,4
amazing frozen custard i like to stick to the basics  vanilla or chocolate on a waffle cone the stuff is just great,4
simply fantastic been here 4 days straight since they opened the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits i would go every day,3
seasonal place that is always a favorite a bit off campus but worth the drivenntake your friends here when its hot and youll be guaranteed thanks all night,3
absurd wait time we waited in a line of 15 people for 45 minutes i timed the group in front of us 5 orders it took the cashier 11 minutes to put together five scoops of friggin ice cream no business this inefficient should be around but obviously the ice cream is good,0
who doesnt love lemon custard  so refreshing  and really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm  the only negative is the long lines  but still worth it,3
pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust other menu items are good as well  the service consistently sucks  its horrible  every time service is absolutely horrendous proceed with caution,0
the pizza wasnt horrible  but the deal was awful  the prices are extremely high at dominos in general  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off  low rating is for price vs  quality  and value,1
very nice place  good atmosphere  we were stuck at aded across the street for a conference and lunch was on you own  saw this on yelp and gave it a try  nice place great view and good food  its a cafeteria do not expect nobou  for what it is its very nice,3
the food here is absolutely delicious i would highly recommend their thai green curry has a nice spicy kick to it and the pad thai is worth a try as well unfortunately the service is incredibly incredibly slow,3
ive only been here once for dinner but i go alot for lunch i work in the area its always fast sometimes gets a little busy but ive always been able to eat and get back to work in an hour i usually get the yellow curry or pad thai its good food not spectacular thai by any means,3
safeways are great now  they have re doen the insides and put in a nice deli type place they offer premade salads that are actually good fresh sushi good sandwiches and wonderful soups since i work in the area i eat lunch there alot and am happy with the price and selection,3
accommodating to gluten free needs fish tacos chips  salsa were great service excellent  also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert,3
if you come here to dine in close to closing time do not sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the latina hussie behind the counter,1
good for only one visit  very overpriced,1
this place is your basic sports bar  lots of tvs all tuned to sports  nnthe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing east so youll never get any direct sunnnmy hamburger was terrible but the shoestring fries were great  nnmy girl jacqui liked her entree,1
the food is overpriced and so are the drinks the atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting the hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside i did not enjoy coming to this place and i dont think ill be returning,0
ordered a burger and it was great  thought itd be a typical sports bar type burger but it tasted pretty gourmet  decently priced drinks and walking distance from the arena  will definitely stop by if im ever in the area for a sporting event again,3
this is never a bad spot no matter the time of day seriously,3
this place does not even deserve one star the place was dirty and the service stunk,0
its so so mexican food my husband loves it i think its a bit greasy la canasta on 7th st is way way better the salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well,2
awesome nnand sometimes when its really busy they take you to magical rooms of the building that you dont even know exist for extra seating nnbut really everything is good here,3
we saw mary poppins and three generations of us loved it the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one the star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away,4
it was ok a mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy food was average at best service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive,1
stay away from this hooters bad food bad service bleh,0
they seem to be declining over recent years but the mizithra is so good we went back anyway  appetizer flatbread was fair  chicken parm was fair  mizithra was great,2
decent burger good salads but really high prices for the qualityprobably because of the location  nice outdoor seating area,1
this is the only spot i trust to get my ride a bath even though i drive a beater the staff here treat it as if its an expensive european car nnattention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my italian kicks,4
they also messed with my side mirror and gave me a huge blind spot which i didnt notice until driving,2
good food quick service kinda pricey for the brown bag crowd great tea,2
pretty good  typical sports bar food calimari was ok chili was pretty good fries were awesome and the burger wasnt badnmy friend had the bases loaded big unit as seen on man vs food it is an insanely huge hotdog with all the toppings could feed 34 peoplenexpect to pay 15 or so per person,3
awesome staff great food and cool decor,4
i really dint care for this place the music was blah and the out door seating was lamethe only cool thing i saw was the big unit a home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat,1
check out my blog review and photosnnhttpfoodtalesandotherfuntumblrcompost24344649924,3
the food was really unimpressive especially for the prices the michael bible cocktail was pretty good,1
super clean venue always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end nnthe wife and i grabbed some custom jerseys as we im pretty sure weve adopted the suns as our new nba team,4
cheap and fast express   delicious hummus and taromasalata  the burgers werent bad   a convenient location for where i was working  myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week   nothing wrong with any of them,4
my husband and i attended the yelp sponsored date night at the arizona science center we had a blast checking out all the handson exhibits as well as the planetarium the van gogh alive was an excellent immersive multimedia mix of art music and quotes,4
this place has gone down hill what used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall its sad that they have resorted to that to make money i wont be renewing my membership,0
rositas is alright i wouldnt file it under authentic mexican food but i certainly wouldnt call it americanized either their beginnings were likely with authentic ingredients and recipes but over time things change a bit i would say the best thing at this restaurant isnt on the menu chips and salsa,3
i write this as i sit awaiting for my food  ive been waiting for an hour now  at a table with 10 other people and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time  this will be my last visit,0
came here for the menudo chips were hot and fresh tasting red menudo has a good taste i still think carambas in downtown glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there b,3
really good menudo and salsa and fresh chips are a must  the prices are great and the food is real mexican home cooked meals,4
2 stars only cause the drink prices are good,1
every time i go to whataburger i get chicken strips it is the only place i can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal,3
i dont know what everyone else on here is talking about this whataburger is super fast  the entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes  great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown,4
i had to take a star away  i ordered the teriyaki chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed it tasted really strange and really soggy  my coworker said it best he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated nnill stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 25 star bowls for them to keep,3
not good sorry i can get pass the decor if the food was good keep going big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end some good reviews must be the workers  no flavor unless you add the sauce a lot the server was very kind so close to mexico we thought it would be a no brainer,0
my third timing coming i really want to work with them because theres not much chinese in phoenix and the staff is super nice however the sauce is horrible more so it seems like every sushi us cooked in the same hiring blabs way too sweet sauce i will not be back,1
wonderful brunch today i had the sunrise sandwich and my husband had the holy puerco  they were both delicious i loved the homemade biscuit  light and fluffy and not dry at all everyone in the staff is extremely friendly  very positive and relaxing environment highly recommend it,4
disney land for foodies fresh baked goods salsas mexican dishes the torta cubana is to die for and an awesome atmosphere plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold my favorite place in phoenix,4
lite lunch with the ladies  two of us shared crab cakes and caprese salad  i could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes,2
expensive and just ok,1
great place and atmosphere great ice cream and malts,4
the best bean burro enchilada style ever,4
absolutely fabulous  why do so many people fixate on the location  the food was super delicious mexican  seafood where could things go wrong,4
should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you cant see the food on your plate underwhelming and overpriced,0
love the chihuly art throughout the gardens i was bummed that the cafe was closed its definitely a great walk this great scenery lovely for photos,3
what a wonderful place to visit especially at night during the holidays this past holiday season the chihuly exhibit was magical treat yourself and go,4
loved this place  the service was great the restaurant was spotless the food was really great and it was very affordable  the pupusas were amazing  i also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well,3
shortly after posting this review someone from pep boys requested i email them about the situation at hand would you guess i received no response what a crock save yourself and do not bring your car to a pep boys service center,0
avoid the lunch buffet  excellent chicken tikka masala,2
decent the dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as i have had in the past the curry was ok and the tikka masala well ive had better the buffet is above average and as always the naan was wonderful,1
came here last saturday night with a friend the food is very good and you get a large portion  i had leftovers for lunch the next day my only gripe is that the naan was a little more burntcrispy than i like i will be back to try their weekend buffet though,3
really great staff  friendly and professional but the facility is beat rugs stained wanted to wear flip flops in my room towels scratchy they need to raze it and start over,0
have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit if you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food dont stop by friday nights the place is packed it you like white pizza this place is worth the stop,3
above average bbq at a resonable price  large portions,2
this was a pretty decent place for good bbq  there isnt that much variety  mostly focused on bbq meat sandwiches  the good thing is that despite the small menu what they do have is pretty good  i had the bbq beef which was tasty and had a ton of flavor,2
i feel bad giving them 2 stars the first time i went i loved the bbq so good so tender  second time i went same thing but i got food poisoning  a busy well known place like that shouldnt have that happen  im never eating there again,1
must have been an off day but still pretty good better luck next time,2
ive been going to this particular one since 1987  it was a ritual to go there right after the copper world race indy car race and  the races at manzanita  great food great portions and great atmosphere,3
the food wasnt very tasty the bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back,0
this zoo is amazing i love that they have two splash zones please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in the barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out,4
it was a nice zoo but very small and i mean extremely small ive been to free zoos that have more to offer you could walk through that zoo in 5 minutes if you continues through at a consistent pace not many animals and they missed out on some really cool animals not worth the price in my opinion,2
ok fooddef not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to i paid 6 for a burrito and a sodanot expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks,1
my cheese enchiladas had nonmelted cheese in them thats a basic prerequisite for enchiladas  melted cheese not impressed at all this place is sophomoric at best there are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on if i could leave a half star i would i will never eat here again,0
unfortunately this place is on a downward trajectory it appears many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies the ones that are there apart from the asian market have changed hands not bad but not worth a special trip,2
kungpao chicken is the best iv ever hadnnfood is great they are fast and friendly nni love this place,3
for the price at lunch i am not sure you can get much better  the food is good to great  the price is cheaper then panda express and it blows that out of the water  i love the sweet and sour and the kung pau  they give you soup and a salad with your meal as well,3
there are lots of great restaurants near phoenix area as a chinese student i would like to say the szechwan palace can represent the authentic chinese food  i ordered mopo tofu chongqing hotpot and boiled beef and fish today all dishes are really spicy and i really love it,3
the staff is nice  tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread,2
good foodnfriendly service only if they are not busyni mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour,1
good place  friendly staff  it has a nice little bar with a few tvs to watch the game which is a lot to ask in midtown phoenix,2
always a great meal tomato moz sandwich amazing focia pizza amazing,4
super cute spot with the freshest of the fresh ingredients tasty sandwiches and salads fast and friendly service adorable country farm feel whats not to love,3
ive never eaten here just had a friend describe to me how he was kicked out for speaking spanish  a bit in shock that a business in america thinks this is helpful in anyway  if its true then i suggest nobody eat here but separatist douchebags,0
the best place in town to watch european football soccer for locals i would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless so think about watching football and having drinks there only,2
enjoyed the fish and chips the fish flaky thick cut with a thin crispy batter the chips a little to soft overall pretty good looks like a great place to catch a soccer game english style food,3
horrible service horrible attitudes i created a yelp account to write this review absolutely rude and incredibly expensive,0
i love this applebees  everyone is super friendly  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie so yummy,3
these type of chain places are noy my jam it was ok they do have some pretty awesome happy hour specials on drinks and food that being said i would come back but only for those deals and only with girlfriends for dinner and drinks during hh otherwise you are getting crap,1
hands down this place has the best sandwiches in aznn1 great breadn2 generous size portion of meat in each sandwichn3 nice variety of sandwichesnnwild turkey is my personal favorite sandwichnbrie boars head turkey lettuce tomato on sourdough bread,4
i always hear hype about china chilinow ive been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about  unfortunately i never made it there prior to the big move but i really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness  my vote still goes to ghohk,1
the salt and pepper flounder is amazing  the egg drop soup is amazing as well,3
oh no no no no  i ordered the tofu and um well it was silken tofu  i would figure that they would know which tofu to use and how to cook it but i was so unhappy with my meal  i will never return and i would just like to forget about the whole thing,0
the orange chicken and house rice were perfect together  we added in a pork dish and it was a great combo  they seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away  the server checked on us consistently but wasnt annoying,4
i just paid 20 for two drinks  this place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous  the kale isnt fresh its frozen the drinks are good but not worth the price just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market,0
rip  off  thief people up in there,0
used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self  overpriced lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago  i am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore,1
very upset this place has closed please come back one of the few places in town where you can get healthy takeout,3
i like this location  they have a lot of turnover but for the most part everyone has been pretty good  wish the outside tables were cleaned more often  they are too dirty 90 of the time to use,3
good stuff  havent had too much of the food  onion rings are delicious  all beers delicious  good joint to grab a growler for the drive homei mean for when you get home,3
delicious finely crafted beer good food and friendly staff,4
average beer great food,2
if youre into great craft beer dont waste your time here the cask conditioned ipa tastes like dish water food was average meh,1

phoenixs best bar  everyone is welcome bored with the usual join the interesting set at c7 friday nights drag show starts about 1030 and daveena ross is an elegant hostess bring 1s to help them fund college or makeup if you like clones stay away if you like humanity come on down,4
as a socially liberal feminist i would never go here but if i slipped up the hiliter  would be my favorite of the genrennive heard that its just seedy enough but not too much and with top notch talent  i mean  thats what ive heard anywaynnoink oink,4
i wont lie ive been here once or twice  not on par with canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley,3

had lunch here on a recent saturday  the pastrami was ok but it was tough and sliced too thickly  coleslaw is good and the pickles were just starting to get sournnthe fries were great but not enough to make up for lackluster pastraminni would go back but with low expectations,2
way overpriced  there sub should be priced at 650 tops  its just okay at best  their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt  the worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion  fortunately there was no rift caused in our friendship,1
great place not a lot of parking  we ordered a pizza and chicken parm  it was really good food and the service was great  we will be visiting this place again,3
excellent pizza and great service  the mediterranean pizza and moscato wine both get 5 stars,4

food was ok service was poor saw a roach near our table not my choice for a lunch companion,0

im so over this place  without fail it is an unpleasant experience  the upselling is obnoxious and they a halfassed job,0
if i could give them a lower score i would horrible decline in quality of service very low morale of employees leading to poor service used to be great and i would go there before any other car wash or other service,0
people are very rude i was told for an extra 100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint jobno wonder this place has a bad rep i had to give it a rating,0
definitely a cool spot with a great downstairs bar the decor upstairs is unique too serving richardsons menu in the meantime but something is missing when compared to richardsons i cant put my finger on it but i dont get the same feeling worth visiting for sure,2
i love the food and it is usually excellent service i always visit the downstairs cellar bar it has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod one of my faves,3

service and food was excellent red sauce is to die  for pregnant girls dream steve was an awesome server order the risotto balls,4
i live nearby  and have driven past this place many times today my wife called me and asked that i bring her lunch needless to say we were not disappointed by these gyros savory meat piled high with the right amount of sauce atop a a fresh pita was a great lunch,3
i love me some merc bar its tres chic from its comfy couches to its awesome staff  the drinks are indeed pricey but they pack a punch so it really all evens out in the end how can you not love a bar thats got a twin in nyc and lets you dance on the tables,4
i havent been here in over a year since i lived in the biltmorenni loved this place  great looking women and not as pretentious as scottsdale pretty low key yet classy ran into amare one night toon7 for a large glass of stolli vanil on the rocks cant complain about that,3
trendy dark crowdednwhen i think of merc bar i think ehhhnnits not bad just not great enough for me to remember it or frequent it on a regular basis  nnthe drinks are spendy but tastynthe sausage and cheese plate is good but not memorablennehh,2
this is a good place to do a lot of laundry in a short amount of time it is probably five stars during the slowest hours i wouldnt recommend coming on the weekends  the laundry carts are hard to get and parking can be limited they do have change machines that work well,2
pleasantly surprisedthought this was just another delicatessen but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone  i just stopped in for a snack but would like to go back and eat a full meal,3
not impressed my salad was 17 for lunch and also not worth it very pricey for what you get,2

amazing food and excellent service loved the porcini rubbed delmonico,4
i have always had a great meal here,3
the room was comfortable the wait staff was friendly and attentive however for the price the food was just ok it was our anniversary so we expected some little treat with a candle at the end but what they brought was a plate of pink cotton candy holly tooth decay batman,2
i really cant comment on the value because my company picked up the tab but i can say that the service they gave us was great and the food was good i had their 16 oz steak and their cheesecakesweet potato crust both delicious would be open to come back again,3
people seem to really like sams though i am not quite sure why  i think it is average  not great not bad just middle of the road food with a southwestern twist  kind of like the cheesecake factory  the food tastes good but anything meal tastes good if it is loaded with fat,1
i loved the free wifibut the coffee was just ok  wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile,2
nothing like an iced almond milk extra dirty chai to get this day started  a must try here,3
this is a restaurant i go to because i am hungry want good healthy food pleasant service and i try something new almost every time may the nice young lady who always has a smile and great suggestion is a 5 star server its also a good idea to order some fried chicken to go once you finish your meal,4
because we are so far removed from the french quarter my stomach rarely directs me to cajun lets be honest there are few options in this town  so this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch  nabove average food better service higher than expected prices,2
the doc fixed my eye  the staff rocks you all get out of jail for free maricopa county jail only,4
i have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable  the food is good  i have eaten here a few times when i was with a group  i wouldnt ever choose it on my own accord,1
you usually cant go wrong staying at an embassy suites hotel  the rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy  you can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too,3

the store is small and uncomfortable but the products are decent,1

this is the best car wash that i have used in phoenix  yelp coupon doesnt hurt either,3
the problem is that the atmosphere is subpar and the drinks are literally half full dont believe me order a 5050 vesper its 50 full i will not return,1
as i begin to write my review i realize the server i am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip this is no houstons what happened to ensuring a well manicured table timely service and a full glass of wine boo,1
hillstone you are overrated you think you are better than you are every time i go i am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back nwe sure miss houstons in the biltmore you tried but its not the same nthere are so many great places in phoenix hillstone is good not great,0
the people working at this store are awesome they remembered me the both times i went in  i will drive to this autozone over the others because they are so friendly  there was a line both times but with the summer heat in az a lot of people needed new batteries  bottom line great autozone,3
vincents market bistro is my usual weekday go to always pleased with there salads soups apps mains and desserts scotty and the staff are the best you know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years,4
as an 8year vet here its obviously a good enough spot to stay a member but unfortunately the facility ins constantly deteriorating at a faster rate than its being fixed  with the constant new members you would think the signup fees could help pay for some remodeling,2
the new owners of ice house tavern are no longer hosting live bands this is such a disappointment to the local music scene,0

this place is always busy and mistakes are made with otherwise simple menu items,2

this place always has a fun vibe and a great patio love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta  good service and nice atmosphere a true staple,3
not good  too small n its overrated who waits 1hr for a glass of wine i would rather get a bottle n drink at home,0
im conflicted on this location on one hand they are very close to home for me the store is relatively clean the service is ok my main concern is the very limited selection of organic food i would rather buy my organic food here but often have to get it at the much more expensive whole foods pity,2
excellent neighborhood shithole  consistently inconsistent seldom open and catering to every demographic in the phx ncant wait to pass on this place for years to come  owner must be proud ncheers  good luck,1
a trifecta of goodness  service food and value  i stopped in to pick up lunch for a working saturday at the office  the value family meals are just that  plenty of everything and very flavorful  also it is very clean inside the restaurant and the salsa bar was well stocked and tidy as well,3
my buddy took me to this place i had some sliders and a couple hot dogs the sliders are very simular to white castles and i wasnt very impressed with the dogs but it was fairly cheap and you got a lot of food fun little location i did buy a shirt haha,2

absolutely the best red curry in history  wife loved the brocoly chicken  i live in idaho and there are only 2 restaurants in phoenix i go out of my way for  thai lahna is one of them,4
the owner was so rude i walked out and they only accept cash and the only reason i gave them a star is because the review made me i mean this guy was ridiculous i never had anyone greet me at the door like that,0
i do not recommend,0
downhome live music dive thats family owned and offers a great value for the money cheap drinks good food no cover usually opens at 6 am most days get over here,4
pruitts was just ok the place is a little trashed the prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be the service wasnt very good either granted it is a furniture store though,1
pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right so i did havent heard anything else back,1
chef cooking in the open facility mostly noodles pad thai noodles beef a most desirable appetite for the hungry man couldnt take this to heart,2
went there for an oil change recently  didnt know if theres going to be a wait time so i called ahead and make an appointment  in and out of the store in under 30 minutes  great service and friendly staffs,3
food is good but i was told i could not have a refill on my soda completely turned off by this you charge me 2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill shame,2

i went there recently and in the past it used to be my go to place sadly the food is not what it used to be and i no longer crave their chimichangas anymore as for the drinks yes these margaritas are one of the best might just go for happy hour for now on,1
my husband took me to dinner here once for such a big venue it was extremely empty nonce the food arrived i knew why the food was so bland i could have made dinner that night for way cheaper,1
the store is supposed to open at 9am and the lady in the store seemed crabby and put out that she had to unlock the door at 905 she walked over flipped the lock and walked away in a huff i was there for 15 minutes and she didnt even say hello,1
really liked the food the fiancees sis got some sort of veggie fajitasill def get that the next time i go back not much else to say it was a mexican restaurant they are so numerous in phoenix its hard to be super impressed id definitely go back though everything on the menu looked tasty,2

this company is good at cleaning your pockets and thats it terrible experience even after they were sent back to reclean this company does business under numerous names so check out the phone  number  buyer definitely beware  awful cleaning service,0
wasted my time going there at 658pm friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm,0
our family has frequented shogun for years and we are done the service is awful and the food has gone  downhill while i hope that their manager shelly has success turning it around it is obvious that the owners dont care our friends are saying the same thing,0
sushi was very good and fresh the restaurant was very busy probably due to the 025 draft beers on monday nights the sushi counter was kinda awkard with high panels,2
i will not be ordering from here again the only good thing i ordered was the cream cheese wontons all of the vegetables had a really funky taste and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor,0
best hot and sour soup ive ever hadnntake out its a hole in the wall family owned and ran great people ive been going here since a kid service and quality are consistent make sure you call in your order takes forever but thats how you know its fresh,2
they have really good cheap sandwiches for lunch,3
i had to call 3x  before i got a call back for an estimate  still went with the company paid 50 and waited 15 weeks before i had to call to see what the status wasthey were done but never called tell menow lets see how long it takes before they finish the job frustrated customer,1
i been going to lims for more than 7 years their food is delicious they have the best friesorange chickenrice crab puffs and chicken wings in town its also super affordable and the waitresses are always super nice  i highly recommend to take your family here,4
disgusting typical cheap dirty greasy americanized chinese food clean your damn restrooms chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli hot and sour was pure barf dark,0
one step above a hole in the wall buffet place  food was edible  very bland service was very unattentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot  ill take my money elsewhere,1
menu looks like every single chinese takeout place on the east coast and they arent pretentious  clearly im not in california anymore  fantastic  this place made me pretty dang happynnits rot gut chinese  boom,3
average food very limited delivery area and abrupt customer service  very meh,1
the pizza and wings are okay nothing special the wings were pretty good for baked but arent going to win any awards nnbest thing about the pizza is the sauce which is on slightly on the sweet side making this better than the typical nonchicago pizza,2
super veggie pizza steve is always totally friendly solid craft beer selection with 10 or so taps  why dont they make their appsmusic is good as well  but they usually have the same groups  one of my favs in the 51 corridor,4
friendly accommodating and the pizza and wings are always good  it is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out,3
we us az sunrays for gymnastics and danceand i couldnt be happiernnmy daughter is constantly asking when we are going againnnstaff  friendly and want to teach their techniquenfacility  cleannclasses  engaging for the kids,3
this was some of the worst sushi ive ever had especially for the money i could barely get it down the place is dumpy and depressing inside all around terrible,0
i ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich a small order of pasta salad and a drink and it came out to 13 for 13 i could of gone to a restaurant paradise bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off,1
yucknni have not been cooking lately  busy with work and homenni went there for homestyle food and it was not good  nnalso like the previous reviewer the server did not know anything about homestyle food,1
quick helpful and clean  what else do you want,3
wonderful daycarepreschool my kids have been there for 2 years and we have had great experiences with all of the teachers they have a christian environment which at this age is perfect for any religion a good foundation of bible stories god and kindness which we can build upon at home,4
service is almost always slow and food is just okay even my beer was warm tonight kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant,1
stick with sandwiches  everything else is soso,1
good service  free sufficient size samples and not just a spoonful  the regular size is more than enough when i was there they were out of a lot of flavors though,2
carolinas your enchiladas ruined it for menni cant imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met mole overload and nonexistent chile lacking any real taste to it whatsoevernndisappointed,1
had some tamales and they were one of the worst i have ever had there is no way this place is the best in town now i am not condemning this place i will come back and give them another try i will try something different and maybe i might change my mind but i just dont get the hype,1
the best beef tacos in the valley i also love the salsa because it has the right amount of heat the homemade tortillas are excellent and i always get an order to go i would give it five stars but the building is a dump still love carolinas though,3
if you arent afraid of the atmosphere youll probably like this not for anyone that has any diet restrictions but man was it packed and cheap i felt like we had found the dallas buyers club of z mexican food,2
chorizo and bean burro and the butter tortillas are a must have the tortillas here are sooo good,3
crap crap crapnnyour local independent weekly owned by a huge corporate conglomerate that owns something like 16 other independent weeklies in other townsnnhorrible layout  horrible entertainment writers great for puppy training and starting firesnncrap crap crap,0
love their fried fish with fries and the endless supply of ranch oh sooo good the price is right the service is ok theres room for improvement call in your orders during rush hours,3
they have good kettle corn,2
i feel so bad for those live midget horses it was so hot out there and one was limping my wife was so bummed and it ruined our whole shopping experience nnother than that its the same ol parkn swap just getting smaller and smaller every year,0
there was a wendys thats it in my terminal worth mentioning  bathroom doors dont lock,0
i know this place intimatelygood customer service from all the airlines great fast checkin of luggage and the airlines are usually on time  food is mediocre though  baggage claim can be a bit of a wait thoughusually 2030 minutes,2
lots of construction going on here but the traffic is never heavy so its ok they have decent places to grab food and have cool trinquet shops for souvenirs  i come here cause i dont think there is a choice,2
the tsa was extremely friendly and understanding,3
typical airport moody security and the boarding areas are pretty small,2
free wifi spread far out but i guess if you have one thing in arizona its space,2
great airport to fly in or out of,3
most confusing airport ever ive been to quite a few airports and ive never seen an airport so difficult to navigate that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside  just very poor signage  airport is nicely updated though,1
i will give it that its a friendly airport but it feels very dated in areasnnim not a fan of the setup that much either  now in fairness im used to the tucson airport but it just isnt very intuitive once you get insidennalso the concourses that ive been on have been lacking in quality food choices,2
sky harbor in general is good but terminal 2 not much of anything limited restaurants and only few flights that fly out there if you coming to terminal 2 then plan on not waiting out here too long,2
late night great food as always  very clean and staff was awesome,4
the food was mediocre the shrimp in my cocktail was stiff and rubbery and the margarita i ordered was more ice and salt than alcoholi would have settled for fast food instead the atmosphere is nice and inviting and the staff are courteous but take a while to get to you after initially ordering,1
called today to order a pizza was told they wont deliver to me no reason why nothing i wont order from them again their loss funny they used to deliver here scoffs  guess my money isnt green enough for them,0
great diversity of plants and they have christmas trees this time of year ill definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car,4
i frequent jays  best gyro deal in the area  the place is not fancy at all  dont expect that great of service  be sure to listen for your order to be up  it is barebones but my stop in tempe for gyros,2
keep hearing great stuff about this place  so today i am going   i will see if i have to change by review after i eat therennmade it there and it was worth it  great fish and chips and peppersauce burger for the son  we will be back,4
nice place to get grocery and gas its a convenient neighborhood grocery store in south phx,3
tbone steak ride was wonderful  horses are beautiful and well cared for,4
unique experience but dont get suckered into the ride at night and then t bone dinner at a cabin in the desert the cabin is a restaurant behind a neighborhood that is ok but not worth the 50 you will spend for two people,2
took our guests from ohio to see this unique place and we wanted to see it too we waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates very under managed and disorganized we left to see other sites could not wait all day,0
decent food when in the mood for chinese i go here sometimes i even have it delivered food is good and service is great,3
totally can not talk crap about this place there was no line today at all food is very tasty and fresh service is nice quite interesting experience if you have not been there and absolutely worth checking outnnnot 5 starts for price and upkeep  i feel both cold be somewhat betternni likenneugene,3
the ambience and the setting is awsome but i expected a lot more from the food  came out slighlty on the cool side so by the time i was finishing my plate it was warm at best  we had breakfast but i will be going back to try their lunch and dinner,2
ok  i havent been to this restaurant in about three years i went back thinking it was going to be the same o same owhich i loved it turned out to be a very big disappointment wont be back plus they were rude,0
i love this location  the staff is always awesome and super friendly especially at night   out of the taco bells ive been to in phoenix this is definitely my favorite for that very reason,4
the smoky smell of grilled chicken lured me in from downtown phx the chicken is grilled over fire and the style is truly sinaloa the chicken comes with rice beans a grilled jalapeu00f1o  tortillas and a small side salad the beans and rice taste home made and the chicken is delicious,4
what a truly amazing view and ride through that mountainside i will recommend this place to anyone that ends up in the area it is something to see for sure,3
great service reliable and friendly i just needed a new headlight installed and they were quick and accurate the price is right  i will go back,4
could be the most inefficient operation  they had one guy moving cars and four other guys standing around took over an hour to get a wash and that included no vacuum as well,0
this is my favorite sushi spot  the price is right the staff is friendly the sushi is pretty darn good and the ambiance is nice and cozy  great for a date or even just lunch  i can walk out full and sakied up for 20 bucks,4
some days on the way to work i will make a stop here i order the same thing the southwestern bagel sandwich its always really good i would say split it with someone its really a lot of food plus it comes with a cup of fresh fruit its a good start to a day i would say,3
best lo mein anywhere in this town their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced we paid them many visits and were never disappointed they deliver as well,4
we use to love this place but the food  value ratio is on the decline we had the thin crust pizza and it tasted like crackers with red sauce we enjoy the live music and warm tea on the patio at sunset but it has changes so much i am not sure if we will give it another try very disappointed,2
staff is excellent and knowledgable  flatbread was fantastic  very cute and great atmosphere,4
overpriced and overhyped food last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line,1
great happy hour specials they also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to theyre facebook fans,3
our visit was the climax to a wonderful eveing out and the staff were so awesome in describing their menu and how it all worked,4
everything here is delicious  burgers on pretzel buns is where its at  and the fish tacos were amazing and i dont even like fish  if youre thinking about trying is place do yourself a favor and go,4
decent food we ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu my entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite drinks were good and service was nice but slow,3
read in the paper this location has closed it was a decent place to eat at the handful of times i went there hope something good goes in its place fast,1
just makes your day better when you have friendly service and a yummy bagel,3
such great service  everyone in there is so nice  my husband bought my engagement ring at ganem and they are always so helpful whenever i bring it in to get cleaned or buffed  great staff  never any pressure to purchase  the only jewelers we will use from now on,4
i didnt like this place red velvet cake is my favorite so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one first of all this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place second of all the red velvet didnt even taste like red velvet it just taste like a bland chocolate cake,0
i have been here once and tried the red velvet cake and it was great if only they were open on sundays too nnwill definitely go again,4
this is an alright place if you havent experienced some of the much better places in arizona  i think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isnt anything to rave about,1
was visiting friends and found this place thanks to yelp the food was good but not good enough to warrant 4 stars,2
had the super nachos and hard shell taco nachos were loaded had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat,3
great food good prices and a good menu only downside is the wait is a little long and the place is cramped overall a great place for your die hard mexican food lover,3
the food is good but too pricey for a hole in the wall restaurant this isnt anything special that you wouldnt find at any other mexican place nnwhen i was there a man came and bought a 20 dozen tamales  frozen who in their right mind pays that much for frozen tamales,2
i freaking love this place their arizona burrito with chicken is amazing my favorite little hole in the wall mexican restaurant,4
hair cut and price for 2 yorkies poor and it stunk smelled bad,0
this place just might be the home of the best gyro that ive ever tasted i have weekly cravings for niros which i often give in to and i live about 20 minutes away the service is great as it seems that the owners are always at the front register to chat with while youre waiting for your gyro,3
ive been going to niros for over 5 years  i think the gyro is really good  being from chicago we love our gyro so im glad this place is near my home   if you get the double gyro plate they give you a lot of meat  just wish they would give you 4 pitas since 2 is not enough,4
great servicenwritten on 4242012,4
this best buy is not as new looking as the one by the mall but i feel like the employees here are more knowledgeable and helpful than at the other location,2
i will never be back to this best buy and would advise everyone else to find a more customer friendly store,0
i thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late not 11pm or a few minutes before boo,1
eye priority is a fantastic business  quality and professional eye exams by caring optometrists  fashionable and large selection of frames to choose from coupled with a extremely helpful staff no better place for prescription eyewear in ahwatukee,4
unexciting bland and expensive nservice was good if somewhat snobbish nfood was nothing special run of the mill bland italian fairnnall in all its probably not worth it especially for someone like myself who is really not italian fan nni no likenneugene,2
pretty good happy hour not very authentic sushi i hate people who think the can say they love ra but the only thing they get are the california rolls if youre looking for authentic japanese sushi stay away fun atmosphere pretty good service cheap happy hour but ive def had better sushi,1
food is barely average and going down hill fast service is not great but they try but they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while gross,1
after getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre mongolian beef here i think i would avoid any future contact with this establishment,0
this place has the best gourmet shrimp bacon  avocado tacos yum,3
how the mighty have fallen  service is pure crap,0
this place is beautiful hospitality is great food is good gym is good plenty to do here and plenty of swimming pools worth checking out,4
awesome resort and fabulous water park  great for the family,4
fun atmosphere great drinks and tasty food my wife and i had a great dinner here we will be back when were back in phoenix,4
view was incredible service was quick and nice fried bread was delicious  steaks were mediocre  vegetables and sides were awful,1
simply putive had better  i ordered two meals with fried rice  the rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable yuck  crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say i think panda express does it better,1
first time to waffle house and we were not disappointed selection is basic but service was friendly and the hot and delicious was served in under 5 minutes we were headed out of town and this place was perfect for a hot meal on the go,3
i really really wanted to like this place because its relatively close to our house the prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way and the tom yum gong soup was bland not sure how you can make that soup bland but they did it the undercooked food was enough to cure me for life  i wont go back,1
heard good things but did not even measure up very blandreally man its thai how can it be flavorless dont waste your time,0
we went to mr chaos friday night to get away from the wild horse pass resort for a while  the food is fantastic  we loved it so much that we went back on saturday after a full day of golf  we were told the owner cooks all of the food try the dumplings  this is a hidden jewel,4
this practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off  from now on i am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail,0
summary every dish and i mean every dish tasted like it was under a heat lamp for 6 hours i expected much more they had a great selection of sushi classic chinese dishes stir fry counter and extensive seafood bar it is a shame that all were so bland i will not be back,0
excellent food as always,2
this location is clean and efficient  our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out very quickly  the food is all fantastic and of good quality,3
i love this petsmart i shop here adopted my cat and my dog here use the grooming salon well not personally and just really like everything about it and its employees they really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need,4
the groomers there werent very nice to my dog hes very sweet and well behaved when i got my cat groomed she still had loose hairs all over her however there hours are great 8 am8 pm it cost about 65 bucks to bathe and groom my cat more money for my dogs,0
this place is pretty good i was surprised the service was just ok though,3
had great service here but the food was nothing special  the atmosphere wasnt either unless you are drinking beer  watching sports there really is no reason to be here,2
ick surprised this location has not been closed there is seldom anyone there the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in attention health dept time for a spot check,1
yet again i had to go to this place and yet again i come up with the same questionn who came up with the idea of serving water in those smudgy bottlesnand yes yet again i saw some floaters in my wateri would make this a 1 star review if not for the chicken marsala and hot complimentary bread,1
i have been going to rebeckha lafferty for yearsbest at cutting very thick hair and colors knowledge is great only go to her if she is off wait till she is available,4
love the food especially the fries where its peeled and cut daily never frozen potatoes  everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and dont want on your burgers  it gets super busy lunch and dinner time so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order  must try,3
such a fun place for kids and parents both  great place to make gifts or just to have fun  so fun,3
meh ive experienced better,1
lobster pot stickers divine butterfish seared ahi  chocolate lava cake all to die for,4
so slow waited 30 min between courses entree dish was barely warm the manager removed the charge for the dish food was good not the service i expect at its price point disappointing,1
ordered the steak sandwich medium rare  came out cooked medium  still very delicious  french fries were not good way too salty  server seemed as though he did not want to be there with a grouchy attitude,2
good theatre got tickets and good seats air conditioning worked well bathrooms were very clean and so were the floors in the theatre,4
absolutely love the service at audi scottsdale i own my 2nd audi and highly recommend wouldnt own any other brand my service consultant jason is the best,4
when is land rover fast when theyre processing my payment when do they take their sweet time the remainder of the time btw that free coffee is gonna cost you,2
the urgent care here is ridiculous waited for over a hour and  a half just to see the nurse practitioner who was only in here for 5 minutes tops i wouldnt have come here but this was the only urgent care open on sunday,0
i like the pan fried dumplings and the hot and sour soup the entree plates are huge and made to share staff is friendly and the drinks are good,2
place is very clean banana republic is the only store i really go to here,1
very friendly people who work here they were so great with my kids definitely will be back,4
from downtown chicago so used to great hair care but this place reminded me of home linda is phenomenal and after stepping a few feet from the door i got a compliment on my hair i highly recommend this to anybody whos looking for great and relaxing haircut,4
great pizza place in the areawas in town for business  they have specials mondaywednesday i believe  got a large pizza for 999  great tasting and service was great  they have tvs so you are able to watch a sporting game while enjoy a slice a pizza  they also sell pizza by the slice as well,3
shitty pizza shittier customer service do your self a favor and order from big boys bitch i am a customer dont get all snotty with me on the phone for asking questions about your specials,1
always great wings i went to watch ufc with some friends staff is friendly drinks a plenty good staff  this loc  no complaints  my compliments,3
went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show it was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to pink floyd music after the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon first friday of every month,2
terrible customer service they close 10 mins early as customers are getting out and turn them away spend your money anywhere else,0
went by the other day and it is closed  unfortunate now i dont know where to get the delicious sour cherries in syrup i love with greek yogurt,4
my chicken was so plain i was upset with it it was just teriyaki chicken hard to mess up i doubt ill be back it is a relaxing place tho just dont go for the food,1
the best crab puffs hands down,3
dude this place aint half bad and i didnt even have the munchies  you dont have to be stoned here to enjoy the foodnna variety of sandwiches and such served up with a smile and a side of chips or something  doritos anyone,2
never had a bad eating experience at cheba hut the food is delicious and the subs are toasted yummm a musttry if you are new to mesa or if youve just never been to cheba hut before,3
best subs around period,4
i love cheba hut my personal favorite is the white widow its the best chicken bacon ranch sandwich out there their meat and dressings are prepared fresh daily  great spot for lunch breaks but be prepared to wait the line will be long,4
service was fast friendly and everything was so much fun  and the sandwich i ordered was phenomenally good i should have gotten the 4 inch because that was all i could finish when i saw the picture of ice cube on the ice machine i thought i would lose it hilarious,4
good bulgogi and a spicy octopus platter i forgot the name of  id visit again but my eyes tear whenever i walk into the place not their fault im allergic to,2
this place has awesome kimchi chigae kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced the service is hit or miss here nnbut probably one of the best korean places on the east side,3
local shop with a great selection and very helpful nngot to support the locals,3
its okay its nothing like san francisco food,2
ive been here 5 minutes only one hair stylist here doing a trim on a guys hair while chatting and watching youtube videos and consistently stopping should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting,0
they certainly have everything from tiaras to bottles of that stuff you use to create reallooking wounds a little on the pricey side but excellent stuff overall,4
ive never really had a bad experience per se but ive not exactly been helped a whole bunch either its home depot what more can you expect,2
more expensive than most of the sushi places in mesa they make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish i would not go back very poor value,0
i would give it more stars but i dont want the bar to get too crowded,2
wow this is a really nice place ive never visited this cinema before but i was surprised the restrooms are clean and modern the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar i will go back to this theatre for sure,3
this theater can get a little crowded on weekends when bigger movies open up but otherwise its never busy ive been here during the weekdays when it is a ghost town but no matter when ive gone i have received great service i personally like the seats and the bathrooms here over other competitors,3
can you say alot of food first time patron and wasnt that impressed its alright nothing spectacular just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids,1
4 words  rib eye medium rarenand cinammon butter rollsnhands down the best steakhouse  better than outback ruth chriss all the fancy places,4
yoko is pretty good prices are just right and service is friendly and prompt i would recommend this to someone,3
i have been coming here for over 10 yrs  i try other places and always come back to nancys place  they are friendly i like my nails and pedis,3
this seemingly is just for the homenot for peoples clothes i thought it was a joanns competitornnbolts and bolts of fabric on hanging rolls also carpets no one said hello or offered to help us no patterns here they have designer fabric but i didnt check the labels,0
i love tjs there selection of vegiescheesesflowersect ect ect all at such great prices and just there over all selection of intresting products i  am like a kid in a candy store,4
party of 10   made a reservation    had to wait 30 minutes anyway   desmond our waiter could have cared less   food was decent but the service was brutalnnim guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed,1
had the bbq burger for lunch too much lettuce tomato and fixings to steal the taste of the burger away nnlet the meat be the star of the burgers not lettuce,1
this will be quick  was there the night of may 13 staff were less than helpful in fact they werent helpful at all,0
good food arrives hot service is spectacular,4
carne asada tacos are to die for had four at 110each and was pleasantly full to the gills will return next time in the area,4
pretty little dive for some amazing mexican food the street tacos are amazing and everything along with it was superb probably one of the top 5 spots for mexican food in the east valley,4
im still full of this delicious old school edible greatness an amazing staff with just enough snark to make it worth your while delicious burgers and shakesthe breakfast looks great as well we are going back oh yea one more thing apple pie,4
the valley isnt known for its mom and pop restaurants or dives as i affectionately call them but this place was spot on a great place to eat im looking forward to trying their breakfast items,3
still the best dinner theater great for all ages very clean and nice,4
love the organ  sad to see this arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management  the pizza we had wasnt worth taking home  i didnt want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself  fix yer food folks,0
i was in the area so i tried out royal cleaners a bit pricey i thinkthe 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts i had them repair buttons have came off again being that they werent cheap i expected a much better job,1
i sued these people and won please make sure you take pictures when you move in and when you move out office is full of kids that have no idea what they are doing check out their reputation with the bbb,0
ugg hortible service not helpful or smiley food was subpar flimsy lettuce and bland patio has no speakers or mistersbut hey they have heaterswhat the heck,1
have never heard a word from corporate even an apology email would have been nice  id be willing to bet they get so many complaint letters they just cant keep up  or they just dont give a shit  my money is on the second,0
dont waste your time here we waked out after the aggressive jerk sales guy refused to offer us more info on the bed we were interested in hungry commission driven focused on the sale not the customer he even shouted out 12 off was my wife and i walked out the door horrid experience,0
was craving some wings so thought wed catch the game here and indulge needless to say i told my wife im definitely done with hooters the wings arent that great theyre overpriced and they dont hire their waitresses for good service arguably they dont hire them for their looks either  doh,1
got some new furniture and when delivered a end table was damaged  i told them i wanted a new replacement  ashleys makes you go thru the repair process before they will replace the item  i was livid as i did not want a brand new table repairedreally ashleys  i will never buy from them again,0
jim was incredible and he had my honda odyssey looking like new  and it was done in a day  by the nicest friendliest guy ever  the price was right and i had fun talking about junkyards pick a part places which still exist  the final result was a work of art,4
nice 50s atmosphere albeit noisy had breakfast of eggs ham and home fries potatoes were frozen from a bag not fresh biscuits were frozen from a bag service was ok seems to be popular with the 70 crowd,0
waiting room is not very comfortable too busy on a friday be prepared for lots of upgrades good luck with just an oil change  they are good and fast just keep at an oil change only,2
this location could use an update  its pretty run down  i do appreciate their selection of toys are better than walmart and target but i do know that theyre bigger stores elsewhere  in the ev this is the best we have,1
this hospital is the best i have ever seen  they are taking such good care of my mother as well as all patients  the oncology dept is the best the friendliest ever  thank you,4
service was excellent food was excellent atmosphere was comfortable  i enjoyed eating at serranos  the bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent  i had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada  very tasty,4
went here because of the beautiful building and positive reviews we were disappointed to say the least soggy chimichanga mushy rice bland machaca and chicken chips that tasted like supermarket chips and mediocre salsa,0
its k mart not bad just nothing special nothing really sets k mart apart from any of the other conglomerates gotta shop here from time to time for mh exclusives so youll see me busting out my maverick patch  showing it off with pride,2
its home depot decent prices  decent materials convenient locations,2
im pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas quoted at 1929 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here completely unacceptable im shocked it was even warm at all though the cheese was no longer melty and james was hardly apologetic ill order from val vista next time,0
so much wrangler in here this is redneck heaven i will definitely be back,4
i love taco bell just not this one i now drive out of my way not to go to this one the order is wrong every time and i really mean every time bad service bad food,0
40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end  at least they vacuumed my carpets,1
this location blows  from the smug attitude of many of the associates to the downright ineffectiveness of the work they pretend to be doing  it really is awful  unfortunately this location is the closest to my house,0
best buy staff are knowledgable and engaging not to happy with the venders if u will that are within the store but happy none the less,2
chicken is to die for on a recommendation from a friend we came here wasnt expecting anything special boy was i wrong pizza was very good we got the new york combo thin  crispy crust waiter was on his game  very friendly wish there was one of these places in so cal,4
this place is awesome i always find an awesome find when i come in i very rarely see small comic shops anymore but this place is great whenever i go in the people who work there are just hanging out in the back but if you need help theyre always glad to help you,4
food and service at nellos is pretty good portions are a good size and the bread they give you to start the meal is delish,3
me and my husband love love nellos we have been going for years and it is by far our favorite place to go for a night out,4
lots of different options and good pizza too our server was a little off but mayeb she was just having a weird day,2
awesome pizza and great service super friendly and a pleasure to dine out here dont forget to try the grilled wings,4
i love love love chevys  their chips and salsa and the best  the chips are warm and thin and the salsa is fire roasted  the entrees are tasty as well but i could easily make a full meal out of the chips and salsa,4
i liked it but my boyfriend hated it  i might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something  they have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends but no way will he want to go back at lunch time,2
waffle and banana chocolate chip pancakes are good service not so good had to wait for about two minutes for the hostess to show up waitress didnt smile at all,2
pretty good breakfast but nothing unique,2
i sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy  slow service and they gave me the wrong order,1
horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like i was told i could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also,0
we only go here for the beer selection the food is okjust dont stray from ordering pizza and youll be fine,1
we love ordering from these guys unfortunately theyre no longer in business,4
wonderful wonderful friendly service and breakfast sat outside but the whole place has a comfy family atmosphere down home cooking,3
excellent friendly service for a great price i brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked brand new i would highly recommend this place theyre just 12 block south of main st by the nile,4
this location seems to go through an abnormally large number of new staff constantly i have not had a problem with getting the correct order but customer service is very hit and miss,1
stop by for dinner last night and place has good food and service was attentive here prices are good and the atmosphere is good i be back later to see if the place stay consistent with service and food,2
slow disorganized service and a very rude manager who did absolutely nothing to help the wait staff or us this isnt the first time weve experienced this service but its definitely the last the patio is nice but there are other options in the area with better service and food,0
slow as fudgesicles,0
nothing to get excited about  the food is ok but dont go out of your way to visit this placethe prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at filbertos  at least the dinning room is nice clean and comfortable  unlike many other places in aj,1
the food was great but the service was not nearly as good as the food im pretty sure the staff did not want to be there next time ill just order take out,2
great food decent prices  we got 2 breakfast plates and a coffee 1399  2 pancakes 2 eggs potatoes  2 sausage  2 biscuits and gravy  2eggs bacon potatoes   we were seated within 5 minutes   service was nice and sufficiently fast  they even made drinks to go  very awesome,3

gross i decided to try the hotel restaurant this time it took like 40 minutes to get my food and the pasta sauce tasted like it was canned i could have microwaved better food in my room,0
i went to get lunch around 1026 and theres always some kind of hassle with these people the rude woman in drive thru said were not serving lunch right now but when i went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 1020 wtf  i left this dump what a lousy way to start the day cocksuckers,0
friendly casual atmosphere with very tasty pizza  huge variety of toppings and an excellent olive oil base  i find the pizzas with tomato sauce to be a little bland but all of the rest have been fantastic  salads are huge and fresh,3
best pizza in ahwatukee hands down its also the kind of place that reminds me of home which is a great compliment,4
i really  like nypd food and service dont sit on the patio though they forget about you out there i was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there i did eventually come back because i like their food,2
crispy thin crust and fresh flavorful ingredients  very highly recommended if you want a good quality pizza,3
i love love love angel sweet i just wish it was not in chandler its a little bit pricier than most gelato shops i have been to in phoenix but not a big deal they have a nice variety of choices but my favorite by far is brownie batter but they only have it every once in a while,3
good stuff nnwatermelon gelato is tasty thumbs down for styrofoamnn kid behind the counter was super friendly but the place was in a busy strip mall and deserted nnthumbs up for homemade gelato all for that nnreally want for a place like this to succeed good stuff large portions,3
i gave this place 5 stars in the past but i have changed my mind since new owners have taken over  they have raised their prices and you can only get one flavor for the kid size which you used to be able to get two  thumbs down,2
4 opi  read carinas review bc i didnt want to pay 850 at ulta geez so cheap alot of the opi colors already have separated heat  age so make your choice for price over quality im so cool for 4 thoughnnon the same end where china magic noodle is same plaza as lee lees,2
the care i received here was satisfactorynmy complaint is every time i have called i am on hold for at least 10 solid minutesnthe vibe is a little aloofnthe only person who has been helpful is martha in billing thanks martha you are bringing the place up a notch,0
sigh  the taco plate was skimpy and bland  i dont mind getting a small portion but dont charge me 821 for itnnget ready to drench your flavorchallenged tacos in hot sauce  maybe try a burrito insteadnnone word disappointing,1
i wish i could give them 10 stars the service is always top notch and i love the chimis,4
a little pricey but worth it its typical to spend around 15 for 2 people which for fast food is up there even though the yelp pricer thing say cheap turkey with corn and mash potatoes and mac n cheese mmmmm i only with they still had the sirloin,3
best pho in phoenix and the best price  no place better and no place cheaper  me an my wife go back again and again very very very good  12  14 dollars two people with water as drink you cant beat that,4
really good vietnamese food good service i always order the same pho soup egg noddle seafood style,3
great location for finding better clothes i have found east mesa south gilbert chandler and northwest scottsdale to have the best clothing at these goodwills i love 50 saturdays and service is usually pretty good just try to beat the crowd early on the 50 saturdays or go later in the day,3
i really like that the free weights are separated from the treadmill area pool is nice trainers are great too i usually go after work and its never too crowded they also have some great spin classes,3
as a partner in the property management industry i have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks  the staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit,4
good simple american italian food prices are great service is pretty fast navoid wednesday night as its lowery organ test night loud oldtime music not sure why,2

food was okay my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful the best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips but ive still had better,2
great food really like the green chile burger  i know i order a burger from a mexican food place but its awesome also they bring sopapillas sic after your meal which are delicious service has a tendency to be slow never got refills but otherwise a good place to get your grub on,3
extremely poor customer service  the owner lied to me when i came to pick up my clothing and it wasnt ready that was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready theres nothing special about this place,0
the tacos here are street style which means that they are muy tiny  i have been here around 4 or 5 times and they are always overloaded with cilantro  customer service is very good however,1
i really like the convenience of drive thru starbucks but this one has a traditional vibe that makes me want to get out of my car they are friendly and always get my drink right,3
great coffee and snack selection  they are friendly and efficient  i usually end up here more than i expect because einstein bagels next door tends to let me down so i walk right over here and they consistently great,3
hands down i love this place they  have everything lots and lots of variety from imported goodness to the freshest produce a chefs dream yes i believe so ni can always find what i need here,4
yes it smells but when ive been here i just imagine traveling to all the countries depths and dark places to get all the things they have here,3
international az,4
we did take out  chichen beef and shrimp with veggies was very good  salad we threw out which was iceberg lettuce with a dab of some sweet asian salsa type stuff  fried rice was extra cost  2 people came to 30 bucks  15 a plate is too much for takeout,2

found this place from yelp and had to check it out based on the great reviews all i can say is wow this place is super yummy i have a new favorite give it a shot you wont be disappointed my only downfall was they dont accept amex cards,3
i do not believe how this place got the rating that it has i got burnt over cook shumai precooked and dried out chicken  food is bad to go along with the unhelpful order taker  i will not be back,0
i gotta say that if you have never tried pho you may think this place is the end all be all it gets 3 stars from me because of the exposure it has given viet food in the valley  there are much better restaurants than cyclo with much better value and menus,2
they would not even bother calling me back about getting a quote had to call three times to see what the deal was receptionist was very nice but apparently dennis is a bum cant attest to any work since i was apparently not worth calling back,0
it is startbucks just like in your neighborhood,3
ice cream was soft and not creamy like it used to be way over priced,0
nice icecreams with a huge amount of alternatives nice place to grab an icecream when in the mall had the donought  one overall good place,2
a fun stop on a long road,3
horrible and liars  i asked them to not run my credit and wouldnt sign a info sheet a few days later i checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them we will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them,0
horrible wait time waited almost an hr to get help just to make a payment workers are super slow sprint service sucks and obviously the storesworkers also exactly why we went to tmobile instead,0
i love this place the staff is amazing and always makes you feel at home im obsessed with their breakfast burritos and the biscuits and gravy amazing,4
great selection as one would exxpect from a bath and body worksnnbut even better than that great people  they are always so helpful  i will always come to this location,4
swaddee is awesome i love the chicken noodles and the thai iced tea this place can get a little hectic during lunch so go early if you can when you order they ask you how spicy you want your food 15 i always get a 3 but the spice can be anywhere from a 24 which works for me,3
i like the cheesecake factory menu but the portions calories and sodium and fat counts are really too much i like their happy hour however,2
just went there on a saturday afternoon  went to check out in front by the exit and there was no one there no one around  so we went to the checkout near the mall entrance  no one there no one around  i love bn but this one apparently has lousy management,1
ive been 2 times here and both had a good ending i enjoy what i order which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes good service and nice environment,2

its nice to have kids build a bear unique and kids seem to love it  expensive we are going to do it one more time for our kid  thats it,3

food is delicious but agree with other reviewers you dont get much for what you pay way too pricey,2
i usually come out here after the lunch hour rush you would think its slow enough that you can be seated immediately not 3 stars is all i can give,2
drove by they are closed,0

pork egg rolls have about as much pork as the vegetable spring rollsnot much  nothing like the advertisement,1
food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else so if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken their floutas were good i would go back for them especially with their salsa,1
the green tamales are delicious love them,3
ive been there several times trying various menu items and all have been good the chicken fried rice i always start with this on my 1st time in was flavorful and had lots of chicken and vegetables i have moved on to pepper steak and mongolian beef and a few others and they have all been quite tasty,3
great pizza and wings  get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it,3
first time here in and out within 30 minutes i usually hate going to my oil changed because they try to get you to buy everything esp when they see a young girl and lets face it i dont know anything about cars the man was very nice and even took my word  no means no painless thanks,2

the place gets pretty crowded the people working there were friendly i tried one of their favorites  picnic with sweet potato salad the sandwich was very good the salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich,3
great food always fresh and innovative items on the menu the staff is very friendly and attentive to whats going on i also like that much of their produce comes from local sources,3

unbelievably uninspiring breakfast chilaquiles was cold so i got the biscuits and gravy dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor i have never posted a review on yelp but this meal was so bad i felt i had to nothing original on the breakfast menuwill not return,0
hands down can not get enough atmosphere food employees and location one word bomb,4

love this little mexican burrito shack the carnesada is good i love the beans and rice too,4
best burritos ive ever tasted from nv to az seriously cant find anywhere comparable,4
everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad food poisoning and almost die,0
decent coarse greens were a little fast as they were a little under watered  the place is definitely a little over priced and snooty for its location  you are a golf course in san tan valley the attitude and prices would be expected up in snottsdale but not in the middle of the freaking desert,1
we used to love this place and would come weekly  my wife is a regular here and has in the past thought very highly of mikadonnlately the food quality has dropped quite a bit and the service has suffered  we arent sure if we will be coming back,1

i stumbled across this place while looking for lunch great hole in the wall everything looked delicious i had the gyro not too shabby,3
i dont think i saw an employee for the first 10 minutes i was in there once i basically ran into one he was helpful,1

eaten here for 10 years best sushi ever fair prices and very nice people,4
place has great food service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the waitnnhighly recommended place for breakfast,3
coming from michigan which has one or two outstanding delis chompies was a huge disappointment  their corned beef was lousy compared to vienna brand  their prices are beyond ridiculous  i will continue my search for a good jewish deli in arizona,0

i really like the food here  its well prepared with quality ingredients not much on atmosphere unless you like dining on picnic benches under the glow of florescent lighting so its best to call ahead and take it home with you,3
always satisfying and never a let downneverything we ordered was cooked to perfectionneach steak was juicy and the seared tuna was excellentnthe atmosphere here is comfortable with traditional flarena really nice place to spend any meal,4
houstons is my favorite spot for lunch great wine list when its not a business lunch sounds silly but get the chicken tenders they will not disappoint a childs dish done in an adult manner the service is always great,4
i prefer all about tennis but sa gets a thumbs up for having a decent selection of tennisrelated gear having widesize tennis shoes in stock xl size socks these are shockingly hard to find plus its really close to home and the club,2
waiting in line to pick up roc race packet for 50 minutes so far and still not there yet you would think that sports authority a sponsor would help organize packet pick up so the participants had more time to shop,1
i talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice the owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story i would not recommend this place to anyone,0
i just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast clear and strong wifi in my roomnwhomever handles that for your place is doing great work,3
i love this place great croissants soup and dessert they are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies,4
if you sneak into the bakery before or after the lunch rush you can snag a cinnamon roll these are the best cinnamon rolls ive found in phoenix they arent subtle there is often enough frosting not the creamy kind to put you in a sugar coma the staff are polite and quickndont forget to tip,3
i was heartbroken when i pulled in and found they were closed they were always busy i went out of my way for their chopped salad i havent found it anywhere else and some days nothing else would do i was hoping to find them in another location but alas that isnt the casenserenek9msncom,4

decent breakfast and service cute little restaurant the fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing,3
best eyecare office in arizona customer service is best in breed and products are a rated highly recommended,4
they do a good job and they will come back out to retreat if you see any bugs  from time to time i have needed them to come back because of scorpions which they gladly do  i have used them since i moved into my house in 2001 and their prices seems fair,3
middle of the road  id give it 25 stars  the shrimp fried rice was very good the teriyaki chicken good the orange chicken pretty blechnnoverall id say it was decent  not great not good but not terrible  just average,1
this place is pretty damn good the egg rolls and crab puff was amazing i wasnt sure if this place was any good but we decided to try it out anyway and im glad that we did we will definitely be ordering from here again,3

had an appointment to get liquid gel nails done  the lady who did my nails was very rude and i didnt like how they turned out i tired to communicate with her but was ignored  will not return  would not recommend,1
highly recommend this place clean friendly and pretty quick in getting you seated ask for tommy he always does a fantastic job,3
be sure to call before driving therethe website claims they are open until 5pm but there wasnt a sign of life when i showed up at 430  im sure the cookies are delicious but i did not get the opportunity to make a purchase,2
i have been going to top nails for years and cant imagine going anywhere else i love love love them highly recommend them,4
average food on a very limited menu  service was barely adequate and the prices were very overpriced  location is convenient but parking can be an issue  seems to be very popular with the trendy high school crowd something i shied away from even when i was in high school,2
i love this place great food and atmosphere but on my last visit wasnt impress with new addition to menu,3
service was a joke it truly absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence nnno happy hour menu nncommunal bar table is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology or at least i didntnnfood is good but no thanks wont return,1
we only ever get the louisiana chicken pasta or cheesecake any more  i think the menu is so big that it is hard for them to have any specialties other than cheesecake  the last 5 dishes ive had have been nothing special at all and one i even sent back because it was so bad and i never do that,2
bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive  at the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone blah,2
great menu and good food,3
it was oknothing special  i ordered an italian sub and it was served on a bunrollnot the italian bread that im used to  i should have just gone to jimmy johns,1
great italian sub also the greek salad is good too  customer service not so great  we do love supporting local businesses  restaurant was busy for lunch  but unkept there were picture frames and extra stuff blocking tables and on tables so we could barely squeeze into our table from boxes etc,2
well this place is good  the food is kind of that outdated tropical fare and lacks any sort of innovation  the atmosphere has that tgi fridays chain feeling to it but instead of shit on the walls its upscale tropicalnni wouldnt really go back unless i was invited by someone else,1
this place is absolutely disgusting dirty dirty dirty id rather pay to sleep in my car also the staff is very rude,0
after leaving jos a banks across the parking lot where there were no coats in my size 54 i met with stewart who happily showed me a nice selection in my size and with buy 1 get 1 free they are tailoring both now  good job and great service,4
if youre hungry for asian by all means go its a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff nnthe food is good and tasted fresh the coconut curry soup is good the pad thai was not among the best ive had but it was satisfying the tom yun gun was way too salty,2
the rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent i will not be going back,1

good dry cleaning at a great price nthis place is simple and good the staff is efficient and gets down to business they have successfully saved a few of my blouses from my clumsy stainsnone tip is to be sure to pay with cash they accept debit cards too but charge a 50 processing fee,3
omigosh we had reservations and they have completely ignored us even let another group ahead of us the hostess is rude and condescending i will never come here again nor would i recommend this place to anyone  we are still standing here 45 minutes after we should have been seated,0
they carry the best products  their staff is like one big family and getting your hair or nails done is like a social event  they are reasonably priced in a great location clean friendly and accommodating  if youre looking for a new salon call them and they will have the stylist youre looking for,4
just the worst owner was ranting in the back and humiliating his staff so nasty and so rude,0
fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store meets the craving for chicago but not completely,1

i feel like ra is too focused on social and not sushi good for groups and decent happy hour prices lots of cute waitresses too,2
fun americanized sushi bar  usually packed with a 30something crowd at the bar  loud music  sushi is average but what you would expect from a place like this  service is good  if you want drinks with some sushi on the side this is a great place  if you want authentic try hiro sushi instead,2
the sushi at ra is beyond amazing  i eat sushi about 3 times a week and if i could eat at ra evertime i would  happy hour rocks and theres some really awesome stuff on the hh menu  absolutely love it,4
reasonable prices great service unique and delicious rolls  this one is also in a great location right in kierland commons  i consider myself very picky when it comes to sushi and this is a place i am very appreciative of having recommended to me  i am a true fan of ra,3
warm friendly   nice and reliable and conveniently located inside pv mall,4
service was good but food not all that great it was 17 for two bagel breakfast sandwichs and two coffees  everything in the breakfast sandwich tasted pre made for the day and the bagel itself was very very doughy always like trying a new place but dont think i will be going back to this,2
if you want a perfectly baked bagel ny bagels n bialys has the best they have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service a great breakfast restaurant,4
food was authentic and yummy it was very inexpensive and you can bring your own wine what a concept no cork fees either,4
this store always looks like a bomb went off every time i visit this location it is unorganized messy and it smells weird the messiness makes it very difficult to find things which can be really frustrating,1

a bit of an older bn but it has all the essentials  good clean store and friendly employees make the experience even better,2
went here once for labwork  my wife had something down the street to tend to  no one was there and it was only me that friday morning  i was in and out in 7 minutes  too bad this place is now closed,3
they finally closed i believe this was the first ajs in arizonaand the past few years it slowly went downhill,1
had a pedi and gel mani done today absolutely will be coming back  everyone was so nice and the prices are perfect nvery very clean as well,4
they did a great job they got us right in they have massage chairs they were very good  they gave us bottled water my daughter got a flower on each of her big toes and there was no extra charge even with a jewel on it,4
this is the best chipotle in town they give the most if you want extra chicken they give you extra i dont mind paying extra for double meat but some of the chipotles are so skimpy they also have the nicest staff not kidding,4
i have a food allergy and they had no idea how to prepare my food safely the worst chipotle ive been to in any state,0
terrible service it took a few minutes just to be greeted by the hostnfood was ok,1
horrible service and gave our food to another table,0
its a chain its fondue but perfect for the right occasion i would give it 4 stars for groups or first dates you get to cook your food so it is interactive giving you something other than your nerves to focus on pretty pricey however,2
if you go here you will enjoy a four course fondue meal the desert chocolate is awesome i prefer the smores option but the others look great also they have many options for the main course this place is pricey and you do have to cook your own food but a nice option for special occasions,3
great sandwiches  my kids love the pizza and soda fountain with the numerous options,3
these guys are great kelly and mark are always professional and i always refer my customers to them  especially for classic cars but they do all makes body shop repairs thanks guys for helping me out see you next time my truck needs fixed,4
great service herethe crew does a great job,4
food was great  we went back a few more times since november  im very glad als fixed the issues that they were having and went back to very good food again,4
i do enjoy the italian bread here but there isnt enough meat cheese or topping to enjoy it i definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the nw corner off the 101 and shea its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings,1
sub par the service the ambiance the menu the best part about zipps is the  albeit limited  selection of draft beer if you just need a casual hangout spot for a happy hour this place will do just fine,1
ok sports bar good happy hour values  wings and the usual sports bar food  food quality is good but salad and vegetarian choices are limited but available  beer by the pitcher  some customers get to loud and use loud foul language which the staff seems to tolerate so be aware if you take the kids,2
i only come her for kiwanis club of scottsdale mccormicks weekly meeting  never played onsite or use any of their other facility other than the small banquet room facing the fountain area  overall service was good but they do indeed need to improve their facilities,2
pool is in major need of renovation bugs everywhere in pool too very filthy,2
amazing amazing place for a mommy and daddy get away here in town  we went on the grinolda ride and our tour guide was just so wonderful for the price of the food and the booze i couldve made it better at home but thats a five star get away for ya,3
i am always pleased at galileos the food is phenomenal and you cant find better service anywhere else the owners are amazing because they really make you feel welcomed and right at home,4
home away from home great selection of cigars wrist watches and shaving products great place to hang out and have a smoke and watch sports on 6 large tv screens no membership fees and you can also store you collection in the back room free of charge highly recommend cigar king,4
this place is comparable to buca di bepponndefinitely for the masses,1
good solid pizza place with lots of charm and great service really good salads toonngreat place to go for a birthday  the warm chocolate chip cookie w ice cream is sinful loved it,2
warning   this location is worse than any used car lot i ever visited  had to cancel three times before they finally stopped billing me  good therapists and good massage but horrible business ethics  do not give them your credit card or checking info,0
they wanted 30 dollars to hem a apronwhen i told them thats too expensive they told me i can go somewhere else and gave me my apron dont like to give bad reviews to little shops but it was upsetting,0
the pizza was very good  the service was very friendlynn the outdoor deck upstairs is a nice touch that makes it a more pleasant place to eat and the decor was a hit with our childrennngood place to grab a pizza,3
terrible pizza as a relatively new arizona transplant i had been looking for a great local pizza joint these guys charge restaurant prices for horrible rubbery sams club quality pizza 30 for shit pizza dont waste your money,3
wow i normally wouldnt review a gas station but this place is so bad i felt it warranted it the angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something,0
the idiot oil change kid tried to charge me 7995 for an oil change that i got at honda for 2995 told me my,0
the price was way too high for an average car wash at 13 for the basic wash,1
terrible customer service high prices careless employees inside and out i wont be back,0
i bought a groupon to try this place out  im not impressed with the wait as i was told half hour and its been over an hour  and there were upcharges  surpriseso my 35 dollar oil change and car wash turned into an extra 32 dollars  wont be back  the help was nice but still not returning,1
its a ups store you bring in a package they take it you wave goodbye to it you leavennsometime after that a big brown truck arrives and wisks said package off to its destination nnthis ups store was unremarkable the guy behind the counter did his job nothing more nothing less,1
evans awesome great at figure skates fitting mounting etc my daughter loves him and her new skates,4
some of the best margaritas in town or that ive had and the food is quite good  texmex style in my opinion as opposed to californiastyle mexican i liked the carnitas and ive also had the combination plate beef tamale enchilada  taco and both salsas are delicious,3
seems a little small and cramped  location is ok prices cheap  salesmen have a weird vibe you can tell they have so many ulterior motives than to actually provide real customer service,0
love kohls have been there twice in the last month they keep sending me coupons through the mail 1000 coupons i can purchase a blouse that is regular price of 3800 on sale for 1499 and only have to pay a little over 600 using my coupon they always have great sales  and it is right up the street,3
decent and cheap haircut with friendly stylists they cut me a little shorter than i would have liked but pretty good for 14,2
i am not as big a fan of this place as some of the other rook your burrito chains but this particular location has the fattiest chicken and on 2 occasions the food here has made me sick,1
slowest chipotle i have ever been to watching people leave after standing in line so long its like this every time i come today thought if would not be bad ad there were only about 5 people ahead of me but itd still forever,1
was very disappointed with the food the hamburger was small and not so hot  cooked well but not flavorful the fries were cold and soggy  the only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive a little expensive for a hamburger,1
yay im a fan is right this is one of my favorite starbucks  i missed it this weekend during their renovations the service is great the drinks are accurate and everyone generally seems pretty happy to be there nnonly complaint please carry more of the chocolate croissants thank you,3
i dont think this place is as great as they say it is  its pretty dirty  teachers dont pay that close attention  our child went here because everyone we knew had their kids here as it was some what reasonable but since being here weve found so much better  its certainly not worth 4 stars,1
this review is solely based on takeout winning takeout we got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing both were home runs i have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time and maybe even try it on a salad,4
excellent customer service  great food  accept reservations  live music  i dont have a single complaint  i wish there were more like k odonnells made reservation for 12  9 showed up we felt terrible  wait staff was beyond kind and we tipped them generously  well return great experience,4
arribas was not as good as they used to be apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership wont be coming back here again,1
im not a fan  pretty average burrito,1
this place is always consistently good  they obviously have a great beer selection on tap but the food is also very good  the jalapeno popper burger is awesome and something ive never seen anywhere else  service is always friendly and efficientnnand of course you can get sixpacks to go,3
if you get the 12 size nacos it is the perfect amount not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person then again it is a brewery i am just unable to drink beer due to allergies so some more drink specials would be appreciated,3
decent spot about what you would expect from a brewpub  this was my first time trying four peaks beers and i thought they were ok  the food was your typical pub far but much better quality  the hummus stood out  would definitely return if in the area,3
hands down the blackened chicken nachos are the worlds best nachos i have had nachos at literally hundreds of places and have never had betterfresh salsa real cheese fresh jalapenos great blackened chicken multi colored chipsno microwave  and generous portionthe best,4
they microwave the eggs and meat and didnt have any bagels at left at 9am  wont be returning though the service was ok,0
we went in again and this time on what i have to consider one of their busiest times sunday mid morning for brunch the service was fast and flawlessnnwildflower and louis you convinced me 5 stars,4
if you believe bread makes a great sandwich you will want to check out this place i had the sausage and egg sandwich on 9 grain toasted you could taste the fresh ingredients that all worked together beautifully i will be back,4
i love wildflower and frequently visit my favorite thing on the menu is the seasonal tuscan kale salad nnthis location gets very busy for lunch so i call ahead and my food is always ready for me when i arrive,4
everyone here is wonderful  make no mistake this is no nationwide vision or lenscrafters  the doctors hear are very knowledgeable and down to earth  i drive 45 minutes to go here,4
exellant food inexpensive lunch buffet  like 895 friendly staff best beans and rice anywhere not much more to ask for food portions are inconsistant i think it depends on whos cooking,3
so the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though i ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco i informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if i wanted a side of beef  i will not be back,1
forget the tableclothandwhiteglove joints i walked in and could not believe the selection on the menu but was even more impressed with the healthy options available i had an omelet and wheat toast and the portion was enough to carry me from 9am to 3pm  and im not a small guy,3
love scottsdale quarter and this store by far has the best semi annual sale selection organized clean and i got wall flowers for 2 refills what a huge reflection will be back a great asset to the shopping center,4
very friendly staff store smells awesome wife loves it do i need to say more,4
we have used target optical on and off over the years depending upon our insurance coverage in the beginning i was very skeptical about using a eye doctor in a clothingfood retailer but in the end they won me over with their service and prices nice job,2
i guess you have to try it at least once to say you didnnwe had the sweetest lady for our server so the service was excellentnnthe food was your typical cowboy farenot bad not great  nnthe entertainment was heeelarious  i felt like i shouldve worn a tengallon hatnnits touristy for sure o,2
hadnt been here in years  the views are fabulous and the band was great  beer was cold food was really over priced  lower your prices and improve the service please,2
i dont write reviews but i had to so that people would know this place is not a 4 star worthy chinese restaurant,0
good on the usual suspects but other than that dont get too crazy on the others    service not good,1
my daughter and i ate sushi there last friday night and came down with a terrible case of salmonella food poisoning  this place needs to close asapnnyou risk your life if you eat there  beware,0
will never go to this place again  gross is an understatement  had to send my dish back as it made mcdonalds look good  strange atmosphere  dont reallyfeel like going on about this place as it sucked  just dont go,0
agree with earlier review from greg except service was worse than poor and entree was hot but sides were cold obviously sat on plate waiting for entree restrooms are located in the hotel lobby nowhere near restaurant needed a tour guide to get there terrible experience,0
its what ive come to expect from wf although this store felt a little cluttered i hit up the salad bar which was varied but not as extensive as other wfs the cheese section was not very impressive i may checkout the one in chandler,2
juice bar does not wash the produce i asked why and they said since its organic we dont wash it be careful or insist that they wash the produce this is a health hazard and extremely dangerous for the elderly and children,0
amazing choices friendly staff,4
this place isnt classy and has a ross in it for crying out loud buti am en love with fredricks of hollywood you wont find a nordstrom in this mall,1
its ok prices or not cheaper than regular prices,2
not the greatest mall in the valley but also not the worst decent selection of outlet stores and an ok food court they recently added an aquarium which i think will add to the appeal its a shame that they closed gameworks,2
there are a lot of good stores and deals here but i dont like to come here during peak hours  this seems to be where all the teens and sketchy people hang out it also gets very crowded as well  come in the mornings during the week if you cannnpro good stores and dealsncon sketchy shoppers,3
rivas has great food large quantities for low low prices  theyre open 24 hours a day wa drive throughi eat here at least once a week,3
im giving honeymoon sweets an updated rating because i was contacted by the bakery yesterday and was offered a more than exceptable resolution id rate them 4 stars for customer service but to average it out i give them three stars thank you for taking the time to followup and contact me,2
had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy  they arent located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes  however the person who helped us was super friendly,2
love the meals they are the best sea food in the arizona area,4
downhill is the key word  i dont know what happened to this particular location but i am shocked they stay open the crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre spare yourself and go elsewhere,1
we love joes crab shack  we make the trip down from scottsdale at least twice a month to enjoy joes wonderful steam pots  a family favorite is the lobster daddy steam pot  even our 4 year old son loves joes  always a happy family friendly environment,3
same kyoto bowl in fact it was a time warp going in  i had not been to one in years looks the same but well worn  food is still good but a bit pricey for what you get,2
ewwww i drive by this place everyday thought i would give it a shot today i took 2 bites and had to throw the rest away i will never come here again the owners should be embarrassed to serve this slop i wish i could get my 7 back,0
val and bill are the bomb great friendly service and fresh delicious food chorizo made on site,3
i took my cousin here to get her phone serviced the greeter had no idea what he was doing 20 minutes later we got some service but that was questionable as well  instead of replacing the phone they supposively fixed it but guess whatnope,0
the streamliner veggie burger and grilled chicken breast sandwich were good but the shakes are out of this world  they stole the show  i got the strawberry banana and my friend got the orange dreamsicle yum,2
so indie its going to make me drive to tempe lol love the vibe here reminds me of the jamaican blue that use to be in scottsdale good mix of a crowd indie punk 70s sounds its great,4
my fav all time coffee destination in tempe its a fabulous place to do homework and socialize,3
i found dr waring not particularly attentive to my needs as a patient,1
my favorite mongolian bbq joint in the phoenix area huge huge portions the only place where they let you smash the meat with wax paper so much sauce and even the side bar is delicious do it and i dare you to finish everything in your bowl,3
this place is missing one key ingredient  flavor,1
this place is great and the service is outstanding i had never been here before and the manager personally helped me i will definitely return,4
in a city full of frys supermarkets sunflower market is an excellent alternative for asu denizens looking for cheapish foods hippiestyle especially since the only trader joes is quite a drive away  on weekends they occasionally have bbqsi grabbed 2 hamburgers for 2 bucks yesterday,4
good food ok prices just hope you never have a problem you want resolved because the management is no help whatsoever you cant expect much from someone who manages a grocery store though,1
went there for a nba playoff game suns vs spurs about a year ago  it was crowded and there were many drunk dirty boys trying to score  ewwe  it has the potential to be a nice littleholeinthewall place but as it stands currentlynot so much  would not recommend this place,1
great layout  it almost seemed like their bar had different venues  great food  selection of beers toonni was amazed how awesome the service was  we went on a really busy night,3
back to the sweet tomatoes we know and love but the updated dishware and decor remain for a classier feel recommended,4
havent had any problems lost or damaged clothes with them  my stuff is always ready when they say it will be and it always comes out looking sharp  good place with reasonable pricing,4
i love this little coffee shop amidst all of the commercial coffee places around this seems down to earth and unassuming  the barista is always friendly  i like to support local businesses and would by far support gold bar than starbucks located across the parking lot,4
this is a great neighborhood coffee house family owned and friendly best pastries around and their coffee is better than the close competition they also have delicious cold brew iced teas every day its a great spot to relax on a hot afternoon i love the friendly laid back atmosphere,3
i cant stand this place  i made 3 attempts to purchase and to get educated on a new mountain bike  the sales staff were arrogant and completely useless  i finally purchased a new bike from another store  its a shame as landis is right by my house  i will not even buy an inner tube from them,0
oh my god worst pizza ive ever had tasted worse than school cafeteria pizza ordered a small at 2 bites and immediately stopped eating disgusting,0
love wendys new salads and burgers this was my first visit to this particular location and i found it to be very clean i felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite,3
the wife and i stopped here for a bite and beer and was surprised the steaks we ordered were huge and very tasty overall good beer selection and great service from robin made foe a great evening,3
wow i really like average mexican food  i grew up with manuels the original one in phoenix  and im happy to say this food is familiar and comforting to me  it may not be the best i can see how some may think its just the worst not me me likey,2
this place has tasteless food that is over priced it is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but i choose to go to suzies or ponchos in phoenix if you want good mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else,1
great pizza at a good price  it isnt exactly like the chicago style that i had in chicago an upside down pizza but it is the closest i have found in the valley,3
ive been to lots of marshalls in different cities and states but id say the staff here are definitely the friendliestnni was in this evening getting a couple makeup bags for christmas presents and the lady who rang my purchase was so helpful and sweet her name was susan,4
website does not reflect accurate stock levels company fails to inform customers of out of stock items and processes the order short when you call to address the matter they very rudely talk over you and hang up i take that as a sign they dont want my business i will be happy to oblige,1
i hate myself every time i wind up shopping here having to lock up my purse indifferent staff high prices  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have,0
generous portions and good sweet and sour shrimp but nothing extraordinary about their fried rice or lo mein,2
went in on a groupon food was good but also greasy but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there nwent there at lunch it was dead but yet took forever to get our food,1
i was not impressed i went here because of the reviews but found that the service was poor the food mediocre and not hot enough for me i am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat i love the food being from nm and also love the heatthis one failswould not go back,0
best mexican food in the valley  yummmmmmy  super nice family,4
amazing service i just moved to arizona and my ac went out took my car in and they had it fixed the same day the price was very affordable and victor and the staff were very professional definitely sticking with this shop for all my car repairs,4
my mom gets a bigger kick out of this place than i do it seemed to specialize in upholstery and the walls are lined with swatches i did like that the woman allowed me to take miniswatches off of the wall but i didnt wind up finding any fabrics that worked for my projects ill definitely try back here,2
i dont know where everyone was but this is a rad little place pretty good food cheap beers and quite delicious very personable staff as well i enjoyed my visit,3
1 star from the vegan perspective as they use whey an animal protein in most of their breads including their white and wheat sub breads please drop the whey and all other animal products from your breads,0
great place to have your battery recharged they require that you bring your own oil back to the recycle bin which is gross and impossibly filthy i really cant leave this place without getting dirty but hell i really cant complain i like getting dirty,2
teds is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but its well worth the wait great service along with great food and decent portions you cant go wrong,4
disappointed as i was told this was one of the best hot dogs ever  we got an all beef and white hot  not the worse hot dogs weve had but not the best  they do however have really good onion rings,2
i really try to support local business and really tried to like this place i even went a few times thinking the next time would be better the last time i went i spent 7 bucks on what was old cold nasty lemon chicken i really really wanted to like this place after my last experience i wont go back,1
if you want some quick affordable and tasty chinese takeout in tempe than this place is reliable  ive only been coming here for a short time now and never had any problems  just dont have any high expectations for something less than 67 dollars for a meal and youll arrive home happy and full,2
really the appeal is the view which is fantastic  the food was ok  the atmosphere was ok,1
the fried chicken wings are good  the rest  below par chinese msg  i might get some wings sometime but the rest of the food is below mediocre,1
excellent prices and the people working there are friendly clean inside unlike other mexican rests in the area the taste of the food is at top game and love eating at this place,3
was in there picking up my items as the older guy sat there talking trash about their customers also overheard in his conversation was a threat to take them outside and beat them up for complaining  as i looked at my messed up stitching will never go there again,0
also went here and there phos free is 60 and everywhere else is 2999 wayyyy overpriced,0
nice clean friendly and close to home  and they dont charge a fortune  cant complain  ill be back,3
i would not go back to this place even though it is close it looks run down and dirty inside both in the waiting areas and exam rooms i did not feel very confident in the skills or assessment done by the doctor or the staff it seemed quick and not very thorough,0
this place is ok,3
this gym has spoiled me they have all the right classes at all the right times even when its packed theres always an open machine sometimes theres a wait for the weight machines the  locker rooms are always super clean and the staff is just awesome totally worth the 50 membership,4
best gym ever they have so much here its crazy if you want a gym that more than just a gym come here i have been with my personal trainer max for a year and love it nni would highly recommend to anyone,4
the gm at the tempe location is absolutely horrible and has no clue what hes doing hes a baffoon and was supposed to be fired a long time ago,0
ive been going to lani for a while and she is always laughing and smiling she makes you feel comfortable right away she has great prices and you can tell she cares a lot i wouldnt go anywhere else,4
i went to just for you to get a wax and i was so nervous i saw tamye and she made me feel so comfortable  i was pleasantly surprised at how painless it was  she was so amazing and ill definitely be back  thank you so much tamye,4
great place for big meals  a great price,2
great service fast lunch on a work day,3
down grading to a one star due to the fact that i have had a few people email me on here letting me know they too have gotten sick from this place eat at your own risk dont say i didnt warn you,0
the food is fresh except the meat which is frozen which is what knocked the place down a star and the service is good for around 9 you can have a bowl full of food white or brown rice soup fried noodles and a drink the place is clean and you can make your dish however you like,3
make your bowl the place was big and clean very polite staff,2
this used to be the best pizza in the valley  the last two times we went we were disappointed  the first time the pepperoni had no flaver  this last time the italian sausage had no flavor  the basic pizza is still good,2
i got food poisoning after eating at this location i almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea i will never eat arbys again,0
for the price you definitely get what you pay for at barros  the pizza isnt amazing but its filling and decent enough for a lunchonthegonntheir lunch buffet special is really affordable though so they usually fill up fast around noon on weekdays  if you go expect to wait in a line for a few minutes,2
what a messy place if you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos even big lots has more order not worth my time,1
do not go here  watch out  they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them  the owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off,0
worse place ever old bad equipment no one working and they sell rides by time and no one working to assisthuge waste of money and when we complained they could not even locate a manager waste of time and money,0
its a chain so i know the food is decent im mostly turned off by the fact that i couldnt come here to watch a baseball game no sports package at a popular burger place ill be going elsewhere for dinner,1
disgusted by server who goes by the name of mike and how he served my children,0
service was excellent by jessica  emily in the bar very disappointed that they dont offer anything for our veterans being that it is memorial day weekend take care of our veterans and ill give  but only one star for now,0
this place is nasty a have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings someone in that kitchen isnt cooking food right ill never go back drive to a different location,0
loved the stadium recliner seats  this is a super kidfriendly area and the theatre was packed with the wee ones good if youre in the parent zone but if youre not,3
i had a great pedicure and it was only 20 my tech took a really long time making my nails look great so i felt like i got my moneys worth  only complaint is that they could use some new chairs,4
not a huge fan of this place although the barber did give me a proper fade i would have to say its over priced for mens cuts and way to long of a wait its not a super cuts and its not a high class salon either so in my eyes it is very useless,1
they got great service but they have slow wifi download ratedown is 110 mps and up is 060 mps  that sucks lol,3
at nails of the world they actually care about u as a person they do great work  my polish never peals they are always friendly ive been going there for a couple years now  i would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends  family,4
its a target you know the drill clean well stocked good prices im a regular,2
been going there for years  sadly after the manager left this place has gone down hill very rapidly  it is too bad cause this drycleaner use to operate pretty smoothly  i cant possibly recommend them to anyone if they cant keep good help around there so long,1
always a great place to bring our little one 4 years old games are fun pizza is always great prices havent changed much over the years highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion,4
happy hour prices pretty good spinach artichoke dip and tortilla chips kind of salty our server was olivia who made a pretty good long island iced tea but wasnt as attentive as racquel was the last time we were in still overall we love the food here usually good,2
they have the best pizza we drive 50 miles to get this pizza there wings are also great and you cant beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good we have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great so dont hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it,4
this place has really good halal kohbedays  however they close pretty early and are not even open on sundays  there hours are ms 119,3
what can i say this is hands down one of the best places to eat  visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter  service is great food is excellent prices are perfect,4
that place is very very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold lol the service was good and their blt was yummy plus they give you a big portion of fries i was bummed that i was there during the wings and onion rings but didnt get any boo maybe next time,2
their green chile burritos are great enough for my husband and i to share too really love the chips and salsa better than many other places,3
i do not give 1 star reviews lightly but this business is beyond unprofessional  their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner and it is the customers who suffer,0
having car problems is already bad enough labor was expensive but expected for a franchise customer service on the other hand was awful,0
not bad a little oily not sure that i like it might have to try it again,1
its pretty standard chain service leaves a lot to be desired and youll definitely find betternnturnaround is quick though and i dont spend a ton of time in the area so its a quick go to thats right there,1
love this dive bar great service lots of drink specials and a very fun atmosphere my favorite thing to do is play darts but they also have a shuffle board and a pool tablennthis isnt the place to come if youre looking for great food or lots of televisions to watch all the games,3
we came in here for dinner and really enjoyed it ive ordered masalas at other places and they havent made them as spicy as i like them to be but here i ordered spicy chicken masala and i received a flavorful hot spicy chicken masala staff was very friendly and attentivenpsni love indian food,3
trashy dive bargross skanky waitresses who think they are hotmediocre food terrible service only good thing is cheap drinks during happy houralso rude doormannot worth it,0
the pool looks nicer than it used to music still sucks,2
please update your hours on yelp we stopped by to get something framed at 532pm and you were closed even though it said 6pm on yelp,1
an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible you will see bundt cake straight from kfc and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it,0
1383 for a tosted mac  cheese no meat but they charge like if it had shrimp   i wont order this again  over priced small portion  and its not even the best i ever had,1
the sushi was not at all good the service was on the poor side our one and only visit was not enjoyable,0
nothing special really  the prices were great especially the 5 sake bomber special  but overall the food was just not sexy at all,1
eh  not badbut not anything to write home about,1
wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning they had the shrimp lo mein beware,0
i love this place  i was so happy to finally find a decent restaurant in the west valley  love that its a local business  pizza is great and ive heard so many great reviews about the rest of the menu  great casual local neighborhood restaurant  great customer service and prices too,3
chairs are uncomfortable the only time they act like they understand  or speak english is when your talking about price  times up for massage  i liked the cucumber scrub  didnt have to wait long  not a bad place to go if in the area but ive been to a lot better,1
great coffee free refills just keep your receipt hazelnut coffee with more hazelnut im in heaven i also got bottom of the pot coffee and my mouth is tingling from the caffeine lol the bagels here are also worth the price,4
the cheapest most tasteless mexican food ive ever had very greasynhorrible cheese,0
any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of they are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses new york style deli that is simply delicious,4
superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt then i could patronize them more often,2
if youre craving for bagels or breakfast you need to go here and eat every  any bagel you can think of,4
we went here for lunch while on vacation  the food was great and the portions were quite large  3 of us at for 30 plus tip,4
had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls nothing was bad but nothing was particularly memorable either all of the staff was extremely pleasant,2
best creamy chicken pesto pasta i have had in a while  steak and pesto is also an option  great atmosphere and lighting  fast service and bread is to die for  a nice italian eatery in a safeway shopping center,3
its hard to get pasta wrong its also hard to stick out babbo does neither a distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop they have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine,2
went early tonight wed to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook salad was wilted main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit,0
incredibly rude service from andrea on sept 13 clearly annoyed i wasninterrupting her to make my purchase i will not use this location ever again,0
worst store ive ever been to they never have anything in stock they refuse to honor discounts and they have the rudest staff ive ever encountered hope this place goes out of business,0
went through the drivethru today got my friends the cod sandwich several hours later one friend had digestive problems ive gone there before without incident but id double check to make sure the food is cooked enough perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe,2
dont bother if you care about customer service one stylist for the entire place resulted in two walkouts in 20 minutes amateur hour,0
so now that ive been here multiple times i must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day every time ive been in here everyone has been super helpful its always clean  everyone is friendly love tjs,3
the sushi rolls are kinda thin i heard a lot of good things about this place i only found it to be ok i was not that impressed id go again but it wouldnt be my first choice,2
no stars walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment i should have left then seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them,0
we love going to this restaurant for lunch or dinner  the chips margaritas and food are deliciouso,3
was a big fan until yesterday hot sauce used to be the best now just tasted like tomato sauce food was awful theyre only excuse was that they are training new chefs sadly we will not go back,0
after being seated at three different tables we decided to sit at the bar  we then found out they were out of lager  how the hell can a brewery be out of lager  the food was decent the service was below average and the crowd was the usual here in glendale old white folks,2
huge selection of beers ambiance is also great food is awesometry the chicken nachosjust awesome,3
i really like shopping here  the clearance racks have some great finds at decent prices  it is the only section i would buy from well other than the skin care counters though cuz prices are steep in my opinion everywhere else in the store,3
service is oknfood is okactually really bland and plain i had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breastnchamomile tea is the bestnngood luck,1
good small portions pricey for simple foods nice environment,2
rude  uninformed staff   sales girl did not know what an insurance appraisal was,0
the food isnt all that great and the mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color the place wasnt very impressive i wont be back i tried it once thats it,1
place is a joke screwed up drivethru order food is disgusting hard dry wont answer phone calling mastercard to do a chargeback,0
stopped on the way to paysonnni was hoping for a good traditional downhome breakfast what i got was dennys quality,0
breakfast is all precooked  ham boiled  ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior  no special orders here  not that cheap either  just fast thats all,0
only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great terrible service and dont have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting,1
today this cafe suck for customer service the wait staff is clueless on the customer experience the food is okay but there better choices up the road,0
the worst fries ive ever had the best pulled pork reuben the banana cream pie needs bananas in it or else it is just a cream pie the crust was non existent overall disappointed dining experience,1
usually really good but today food was horrible  i order carne asada nachos  chips were full of oil beans and carne asada tasted dryold hardly had a guacamole and sour cream and cheese didnt melt salsa was watered down had no flavor very disappointing,0
loves has everything you could possibly need on a road trip  cheap gas tons of drink choices a bunch of options for grub  i knocked down the stars a bit for this particular location because the bathroom was not that clean compared to some spotless loves bathrooms i have seen in the past,2
every time i go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave i guarantee you will always be missing something or something aint right,0
ive been here twice now and im not very impressed  the service is slow and even when there is clearly no one else in the restaurant  the food wasnt much better it was ok but a bit expensive for what you get,1
we loved this place a few years ago but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen both of us here and i eat alone,1
decent food that youd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in mexican food in short nothing to write home about,2
i love eating there breakfast here country boy is my fav love the steak and hash brown casserole my order was almost perfect except i got wheat bread not white i dont like wheat but no big deal mike my server was great friendl and nice,3
the staff was friendly and accommodating i had an arrangement made for my grandma after i left i looked at the flowers and some of the roses edges were drieddead i think the flower arrangement was over priced for what you what you got,1
i dare you to find a better burger chili or steak for the price i love this place it has a grain belt bar light need i say more,4
our waitress was a grouchy bitch and there was no fresh oj but other than that it was ok  loved the sign at the register that read no open carry of weapons  hahaha  i was concealing anyway,2
jerry with time saver is a true professional honest relaiable and has the experience most people only dream about nnyou will not be sorry you called time saver for your plumbing needs,4
awesome place all around,4
this is my favorite local mexican place  great chips and pico de gallo along with good fresh food  at lunch i like the 1 combo taco enchilada rice and beans  i dont order bean very many places these are so good that i will order them as a dip for my chips  friends like chimis and tilapia too,4
wow all the other yelpers were right on with this one  the chips and salsa are amazing  the atmosphere is very cool with the outside misters and big screen tvs to watch the game  however the food was soso  if i were to go back it would be great for appetizers and beer to watch a game,2
very dirty dinning arean  employees obviously do not care about customer service n  mcdonalds should pull their affiliation  very bad representation of the brand,0
i went here yesterday and ate at dillions bbq i had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect the manager was great with me and i will defiantly be back,3
rode over on our harley with some friends we enjoyed a great tasting lunch and a couple brews seems be out in the middle of no where but we like these kind of places bet the place is jumping on the weekends have to make it back some saturday evening,3
we stopped here on tour one time  and then one time again on the way back  had a nice meal some beers some shots hung out for a bit  everyone working there was really friendly  if im ever headed through again id definitely stop in,3
i have been going to the el dorado hot springs for years and always have a relaxing time open your minds and give it a tryyou wont be sorrynmakes for a great day triplets relax,4
staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing everything is kept nice and tidy i just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes,2
they refused to put air in my tires that were purchased there they tried some scare tactic that tires would explode or some bs this is a cadillac that is only driven to the grocery store by my 86 yo mother ni took it to fletchers no problem  i will never use discount tires again beware,0
every time my sister and i come here we get exceptional service the manager is awesome the staff is so helpful if they dont know the answer to something they will go above and beyond to make sure they find it for you we went to another kohls and it just reassured us to always come back to this one,4
every time i go here i regret it the food is not very good obviously but it is super cheap typically id prefer taco bell but the taco bell on waddell and litchfield always sucks so if im in the mood for badcheap fast food tacos i go here,1
terrible conditions in prime time of year mickey mouse layout skip it,0
i have been coming here for years best bakery on the west side huge variety i just cant decide what i want when im there since everything looks so delectable and fresh,4
absolutely the best customer service ever  they always have the best rates and great vehicles  i would recommend them over and over again,4
ehh its ok the location at bell  reems is 10x better better service there  better drinks this one is okey,1
i cant for the life of me remember the barista who assisted me but she was hilarious and fun  i would come back just for her customer service  she was a little short blondie  nnthe customer service was great  it is located near a frozen yogurt place as well win  win,3
slowest and most disorganized starbucks ever 25 minutes for 2 regular coffees and a premade spinach wrap,0
in the store today 2 timesfirst and last i have never experienced such an unfriendly staff  the store is a mess,0
pretty decent location for a nice target storenwhen i lived in the area i would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selectionnlocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops,3
worst store ever had to wait 45mins to pick up a padio set soo disorangized worst serivice iam so disgusted i will never ever return home depot only,0
very good food a nice clean and very friendly place prices are reasonable for authentic mexican food we have eaten there many times and always look forward to going back,4
i was there in the afternoon on december 31 someone took a sharp object to the side of my car and the rear panel they did 1200 in damage called harkins and wasnt even told by manager that he was sorry had to write harkins to even get an apology,0
first arrived and the family a little bored the staff was nice but the displays need to improve great building luckily the simulation our family signed up for saved the day we had a great time with the simulation crew end if day it all worked out great and family happy,2
not impressed by the food natmosphere is crowded maybe they will be on restaurant hoarders nwaiter was a jerk i asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks i didnt mean to insult rocks ntoo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food,0
call ahead eat lots of rolls get the double pork chop and you will be in heaven nnkey is to call aheadnnive never had a problem here and always loved my food,4
food is still good but the set up is ridiculous yeah put the soda and ice cream right next to where the soups and pasta are to cause a huge log jam of people also had a hair in my salad not cool,1
this jacks has been closed  thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place  yuck,0
love the food,3
average to poor food ive had orange chicken a salad and chicken enchiladas they all sucked they all cost more then they should have,0
super cool bar friendly staff and very comfortable environment drinks and food are both very affordable and delish great happy hour specials too its s small establishment so it can get busy but its always fun no matter what,3
its a good thing that this place is not closer to where i live or i would weigh 400 pounds,4
we bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and i have to say it can feed a whole battalion not only was there a lot of food it was also delicious as usual thank you greek wraps,4
the food is amazing here ive been here a few times and love it every time i ordered the gryro platter and it comes with a greek salad and rice i have to say everything was delicious,4

have been here to dine a few times and went for happy hour on a friday night  very decent prices and the food is great the place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar will be back for sure,3
fancy place  not great food nnthis place is a fancy expensive mexican restaurant for people what to spend more money than they should and get far less than good mexican food  i guess if youre from minnesota wisconsin or bc this is passible but it is far from good mexican food,1
great service lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great the green salsa is my favorite will be back to try more,4
two stars just because the chips and salsa are good but everything else was horrific it tasted like frozen crap covered with velveeta cheese rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty we will never go back,1
good food if good can be associated with fast food  but the drivethru here is one of the slowest i have usednnyou come to fast food and a drivethru for a quick and easy meal the easy part they did the quick part turned into a 15 min wait from order to eating way to long in my opinion,2
whataburger has a decent burger but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food this location hasnt been too busy on the few occasions that i have dined here though so it has been quick and convenient for me,2
you can rarely go wrong herennlove the chips  salsannhave become a big fan of boneless buffalo chicken salad,3
love the outdoor patio  the perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer,3
my mouth has a weird aftertaste it could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger free wings on monday night football thats cool ncheap beer they raised over1000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help thats cool we are in wickenburg,1

its a taco bell and pizza hut express combo what more could you really ask for,2
food was absolutely delicious  but pricey we were dressed in comfortable clothing jeansshortssweatshirts and clearly did not fit in this is a dressy crowd we were also the youngest people there it was mostly older adults 65 great views and good service,2
i didnt think it was very good we got the chicken fried rice paper wrapped chicken shrimp pad thai  sesame chicken  none of which was really good the fried rice was horrible i dont know why this place is so busy,1
its just ok  at first the food tasted pretty good but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy  in fact my wife got sick from the meal while i only had an upset stomach  i think well have to find another place,1
after reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch the lunch specials are priced very nicely 6 bucks and the portions are filling the service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl i would come back,2
great environment and great price ask for zulma or rachel zulma can do a killer fade,4
pretty good pizza  this place isnt far from my house so ill probably go back  not as good as my beloved grimaldis but its plenty good for the price,2
my parents love this place and now so do i  it is new york style pizza thinner crust and longer slices very much like we got back home in ny  dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good,3
this is a great hotel they have an awesome pool it is in a good location the maids are always nice and clean the rooms well the rooms are nice and comfortable i have come here with my family 3 times and it has always been great,4
overall this is a pretty good place its located off the strip so it seemed to be a more local crowd we ate at the buffet which was very good as far as casino buffets go it had a variety of food all of which was pretty good nnthe place also has a 72 lane bowling alley arcade and kid area,2
i came to the buffet for salad they had spinach and good dressings  i was pleased with my salad anything else on the buffet looked like it was 20 years old dry gross and gross  however the crowd didnt seem to be starving  at all  so no one missed a calorie and i guess all is well that ends well,1
closed  and the big slides removednnnot sure what is going on here looks to be some renovations ill be totally bummed if they lose the big slides,0
i got a good haircut and style at a decent price the girl did what i asked when i showed her a picture theres a special right now  7 foil highlightscut dry waxed brows all for 60,3
this borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock  you can never find anybody to help you find something but the line is short and the clearance section is nice  the bathrooms are soso  the music selection is great and so are the dvds,1
i got my oil changed in 30 minutes  it was quick painless and i wasnt hussled  they mentioned i would want to replace something but they didnt try and force me to do it then and there  i also got my oil change through groupon so it was nice to see a big company like midas giving out discounts,2

the only thing that i can say is yum i love the pancakes the waffles and the service,4
clean place friendly staff the only negative thing i can say about the place is they typically have 12 printers down,3

fat salad is a fat ripoff   so is 250 for a drink,3

register service was not pleasant im not sure if the girl who rang me up just didnt like me but she was nice to everyone else until i got up to her,1
being a fan of the 299 crispy chicken deluxe which comes out to 387 when i upsize to medium i made it a lunch stop it served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive pricen   on my visit here the service was fine the restaurant was also clean,3
stevie at the printcopy shop is awesome she bend over backwards to help me and got me out of there quickly with exactly what i wanted at a price i fully expected,4

horrible job on my nails never go there i had a smudge and the fixed it by putting three extra coats on and then the polish still smudged,0

make sure you check the price on the shelf and when they ring you up very misleading and disappointing,1

crappy service,0
fast cheap mexican food very addicting love the chicken bowl from there pretty decent healthy option as well as long as you dont add the sour cream and cheese only problem i have with chipotle is that the amount of food you get each time is different depending on the server,3

this irish bar is pretty typical for a casino  ie there isnt much irish to it  but it does have a decent selection of beers  sometimes they bring in very weird bands or groups to play music  i would say it would be worth stopping by and grabbing a beer  plus you can keep the glass,1

overpriced food here the duck was ok but i wish the skin should be crispy instead soft skin,1

bad service and nothing special about itnncompared to other sam woo branch seriously this branch doesnt really serve a good food nnnot a good value dont waste your time and money here especially if youre familiar with sam woo bbq restaurants,0
this place keeps getting pricier every single time i came to vegas  furthermore i felt that this place has gone downhill  the duck is not as good as it used to be  but sam woo is still sam woo  the food in general is not bad in my opinion  just reserve this place for the late night,2

best vegan donuts ever i honestly make it a point to buy 2 dozen to bring back home to my friends just because you cant get donuts like these in socal i recommend vegans and nonvegans check them out heck ive made the three and a half hour drive just to buy them and come back,4
this place is amazing if you are vegan get here the donuts taste better than i remember the glazed are obviously the best but any of them will do top two rows are vegan if you are in las vegas do not skip this place,4
35 rounded up  this is a basic bakery that charges cheap prices  i ordered the cruller apple burrito and a couple of donut holes  i thought all were good enough  i do prefer krispy kreme  has a good following the place had a steady stream of customers while i was there,3

service could be better or maybe i am used to service back in 626nntea was alright too much ice,2
i dont like that you cant just hang out here you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of 5 or they kick you out overall cute little tea place thats open until 2am,2
this place is located in china town in a very popular part of town i love their milk tea boba and mango slush the workers are kind of weird and dont really have manners i still go here often despite the service its a good place to hang out,2

from the outside with all the lights i was expecting more its fun  if you want to kill time and walk around looking at cheap gifts  lots of security throughout shop and you cannot carry any large bags in the store  they will take them from you and you can pick up when you exit building,1

amazing jewelry store weve bought and had fixedserviced our watches rings etc they are wonderful unfortunately danielle the lady who usually answers the phone has poor phone manners i wont give t bird less stars though she just needs to check her tone of voice,4
one of the more cleaner 24 but this review is based on the people that go this 24 gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race if you are asian you are not welcomed at the basketball court,0
very friendly staff great personal service i needed a minivan they offered a journey but the inside height was not tall enough for items i was transporting  they drove to another location to bring a minivan back the went the extra mile to help me get what i needed,4

they cant get the orders right  i always have to double check my bag before leaving the drive thru theyre open late but they have no lights on at night poor service id rather go to sonics down the street  this mc donalds needs improvement  bad,0
first time eating at sonic  they need to open some of these in the bay area  had the spicy southwest burger which has crispy jalapeno strips with some fries and a cherry limeaid drink  pretty yummy,3

holy toledo batmannni just went through the drive thru and they got my order right and it tasted goodnnthis is a first for this locationnni only got a rodeo cheeseburger so maybe it was because i didnt make it too hard on them,2

slow servicethe food was gross chickswaitresses werent hot and a bit rude also maybe it was a bad night but i been to the one in san diego and that was a wayyyy better experience food wasnt great there either but at least the waitresses were hot looking and they were very attentive and courteous,1
this hotel doesnt have the glamour of other hotels on the strip if thats what youre looking for but the dealers were very courteous and made great conversation as well,4
pretty bad atmosphere i have been waiting for 30 minutes with 8 other people to sit at a 3 dollar 65 blackjack table and they wont open another table or even a 5 table,0
when you want wings you want to head to hooterstry to get seated in ashley ss section preferably when mike lee is working and youll get incredible service matched only by ashleys adorable smile,4
hooters restaurant is like it is everywhere  crap  the ladies had no hooters themselves  the food is never great  the hotel room was not great had an iron burn on the carpet rooms need to be updated and they charge u for drinks when your gambling  ok if you can get the room really really cheap,1
we went there with our friends from germany to watch the amazing 71 soccer game the food was great but our server lindsey was even greater super nice patient always a smile on her face and a great server she made a good experience a great one thanks lindsey,4

very sad to say that the bar was sold to a slot parlor  will be closing before new years the staff was good  so was the food to many stupid slot parlors in this town now,2

umm a beer hall in a churchnnthats even better then a club in a church  httpenwikipediaorgwikithelimelightnninteresting choices of beer great pizza and a decent menu of dinner choices,4
its cool that they brew their own beers i wasnt a huge fan of the food and beer but it is a neat restaurant in pittsburgh,1
big fan of the church  their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site this is a must stop when in the bloomfield area of pittsburgh,3
good more than decent lunchsandwich bar food food great beer  but the atmosphere is absolutely 5 stars of wonderful  the church is spectacular and the patio is lovely too  seeing hops growing on the walls outside really makes a point  this place does beer well  and the site itself is just wonderful,3
cheap beer neat setting lots of seating but fairly quiet on a saturday night around 11pmi was pretty hyped in coming to this place but the vibe there was just too quiet and they didnt really have a lot of beer selection altho they did have their own brewery in the background,2

i dont know how you screw up a grilled vegetable sandwich on focaccia bread but they managed to do it slimey undercooked with no flavour pizza was too bready i wouldnt bother with this place i dont even know how they call this italian food just bec they put tomato sauce on it,0
spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting weird pasty sauce whole place seems kind of dirty booths need to be wiped down dont go here unless youre an undergraduate with low standards,0

racist racist racist i came on a wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking i wouldnt hear him gross,0
i love the lunch specials esp the thursday one that comes with an eggroll good prices and the souphot tea is great comfort food for when youre trying to keep warm and fight off a cold,3
the growing number of noodle restaurants is a positive trend but is jeopardized by those who do not put honest effort into it  i dont know what bouillon can they open to make their broth but they need to get a stock pot and some bones,1
everything is oversweet no resemblance of real asian food,1
i have had things tailored and dry cleaned here dry cleaning is fast and cheap but everything smells like old people when they are done nnthe tailoring was cheap but one of the stitches fell out after about a week nnive had better but not really cheaper,2
nothing beats the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream  the cookie dough is always soft and fresh and never too hard or frozennnget it all on a inhouse made waffle cone with an mm on the bottom  the best part is that the mm always ends up a bit melty from the warmth of the fresh made cone,4
its basically a loud dimlylit sports bar that serves cheap greasy 12 finger food after 11pm nothing really stood out and again the food was really greasy nnmeh go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food,1
cooln plenty of seatingn plenty of powern full of activityn free wifi if you have att wireless at homennuncooln long linesn no breakfast sandwichesn bathroom requires a key  i guess thats typical starbucks,1
a convenient local deli which quickly serves up both hot and cold sandwiches its open late,2

first time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews unfortunately i wont be returning the service was superb no doubt but the fried chicken was tasteless sushi was ordinary at best after more than 50 later both my hubby and i ended up spending the night in the bathroom,0
the sushi was delicious the other food didnt compare if i go back here i would just stick with the sushi the waitress and other employees were very attentive nice atmosphere,3
pretty good food interesting location,2

we paid 25000 for our room and there was no hair dryer not enough towels mold on the ceiling in the shower  on the shower curtain liner and dirt or who knows what on the liner  nngood location but the hotel itself leaves much to be desired for the price it was a big disappointment,1

the air conditioning in room 1602 didnt work and the hotel refused to take responsibility they simply laughed and said that we should have let them know the night before we didnt get in until 2am i would not stay here again ridiculous customer service,1
a cozy breakfast spot similar to dennys or kings minus the shit your pants feeling you get from dennys or kings  ive only eaten breakfast here cant speak on the other foods but if you can make a bomb breakfast lunch and dinner should be similar,3
just watch where you pick up your produce,4
overpriced and small portions but oh so delicious nice location not so friendly staff though,2

egg on the burger wasnt completely cooked they kept changing tv channels so you couldnt watch a game all the way through so we left,2
get here early seats fill up quicknni love this theater they always play movies for the longest and they oftentimes play movies that you cant see anywhere else very roomy and comfy nnprices are a little higher and it seems to be always crowded parking is a nightmare on a saturday night,3
staff is always polite and movie selection is great prices arent too bad and the viewing area is always clean only down side is that they dont have student discounts but thats livable,4
chicken cooked at wrong temperature was completely red threw up for 34 straight days lost business over it too fix the kitchen fix the restaurant stay away,0
decent at best  if you know real cajun this place wont impress you but for the lack of any other option its passable  the rat toes appetizer is pretty good,1

excellent food with an intimate feel i prefer the back patio area the menu changes almost daily and veggies come from local growers,4
every time we have been here we have been disappointed we are done no more chances there are much better pizza places around here,0
expensive more than dealership not fast and they really do some upselling,0

this gallery has an explicit policy on their website that they will not entertain the art of any local artist  i hope that the public will avoid them and instead go to galleries that allow charlotte artists an opportunity to exhibit their work,0

this was my first time trying culvers its nothing special and is comparable to wendys or any other fast food burger place,1
the bar area was nice but the dining area was offputting that side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades the fresh bread was burnt and tough the table was a bit crumby i ordered the shrimp fettuccine alfredo which admittedly was bland the server and service were great,1
went for sunday brunch edible items include bacon and funnel cake strips everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from sams club,1

i love chipotle but when comparing this locations to others i get about half as my food in my burrito bowl seriously at home i get enough for an entire second meal after im full it would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls,1
fresh fresh fresh there is no other fast food chain imaginable that has the local wholesome fresh and ethical outlook that chipotle does,3
good food great location good atmosphere especially in the atrium and great sangria we will go back,2
if you like sausages edm and the smell of bleach this place is for you trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge the only good thing is that i discovered amis next door,0

i love the atmosphere of this place total college hole in the wall relatively authentic nepalese food with great service i had the wheat gluten dish which was ok but too salty for my taste and overpriced i think their tarkari is worth it and i wish i had gotten that instead,2
haters gone hate,3
terrible service the food was okay restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food we were literally the only customers,1
i trusted the madison yelpers to help me find good restaurants and madison and buraka was among the very top there unfortunately the food wasnt anything special it wasnt bad in any way just a little bland and not inspiring ive had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago,1

rude racist dark unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine homeless old men grabbing at my date pretty much an assault place attracts the detritus,0
i stopped eating here last summer  i have a rule  i cross any place off my list when im too distracted by all the flies to pick something from the menu  nnid give one star but the saving grace is that all the flies are dead in the winter  and madison has a lot of winter,1
passable middle eastern and mediterranean food in a nice state street setting close to campus,2
the crowd is not my scene  but they make a strong yet decent tasting long island the main draw for me was competitive foosball almost any night of the week its been a few years though,1
i quite like the placetheir entrance is through a quaintlooking garden which sets a romantic mood the ambiance inside is pretty nice the food is good try the stuffed mushrooms they can be pretty busy at times so i would call ahead,3
i went there for the lunch deals only but i cant say im impressed with the food service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling but their pasta is very overcooked its also a bit dark inside the place but its nice and quiet for the most part,1
ok place but had betternsteak was ok although for the price i was expecting betternwe were seated on a table and the seats were smallnno parking had to drive around till i found a ramp with pay meters not too far,2
the outdoor seating was nice  margaritas were pretty good  food was not good at all  so if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink its nice  if you want good food go somewhere else,1
i went in was seated and told a nice young lady will be with you in a minute i sat closed my menu stared out the window read from my book sent some texts i then watched a couple next to me get seated and receive drinks and menus ni got up and walked out,0
i would have given this place 3 stars for okay but not greatgood food but given that i got violent food poisoning after eating here and was up from 130am630am vomiting every hour or so i have no choice but to go with 1 starnnas a dive bar it seemed cool though,0
not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable no apologies at all from the staff either finally got our food not worth the wait  skip it,0
its true that kabul isnt really memorable but its kabobs are good it feels like a restaurant on a college campus should  like its just managing to get by its good food,2
the food here is soooooooo good  i ordered a vegetarian dish and words can not explain how good it was  enjoy  cheers,4
meh it was fine but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken but they ignored the mistake as if its how the dish comes out maybe im ignorant to afghan style beef or maybe they were to lazy to fix the issue either way they handled it terribly and the service was lacking bleh,1
bait and switch  theyll let your children participate in creating a craft and then charge you to keep it,0
love the mac and cheese,3
this microbrewery is definitely a centerpiece of madisons dining and drinking scene  im surprised nobody else has reviewed it yet  pretty cool place with frequent live music a back room with pool and darts and an expansive menu showcasing the best artichoke cheese dip ever,3
really love the mac n cheese with meatballs almost too rich but the texture of the pork meat provides a nice contrast to the pasta  cheese portion size is fine for any normal sized society only gets a somewhat inflated 2 stars cause id rather just say no to their asian dishes than be disappointed,1
the clothes etc are nice but the people who work here are so snotty  i just want to say to them youre in madison wisconsin  this is not rodeo drive or fifth avenue  drop the attitude  i dont need to be treated like scum when im out to spend money  ill avoid this store from now on,1
wont be coming back   the food was only mediocre and the service was bad,0
german beer hall type place dark and woody with lots of stuff on the walls and ceilings beer was good and served in a large heavy glass people were enjoying the bar while the badger game was on very noisy at times if you want a german beer hall good time than this just might be the place,2
cant beat 2 for a any size latte on wednesdays  small latte  2 please  medium latte  2 please  large latte  2 please  you get the idea  hint  id go with the large,2
i still stand by the previous review i do stop by if i am in the neighborhood and need coffee however this just isnt a place to hang out on a whim anymore  its usually packed between the hours of 10 to 6  outlets are at a premium bring an extension cord and a power strip,2
oh and get the weird maple candy waffles,3
fast and tasty sandwiches good baked goods and soups and a wide array of microbrewy beveragesnnthat said their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly fauxjoanna newsomy,3
my favorite sandwich place absolutelyni love their italian sandwichalso their meatball onethey know how to make it delish without making it soggy with the sauceni think their store on state st is pretty coollove sitting there and chatting with the wife,4
they make good sandwiches my friendordered a vegetarian sandwich and lo and behold i liked it so that says a lot about their ingredients but i dont think its worthy of a lot of return trips n n better than silver mine sandwiches but not as good as the old fashioned,2
legit breakfasts and fair prices layout is cafeteriastyle the employees are pretty nice fair ambiance and lots of windows probably good for a snowy day good coffee toonnas other reviewers said there are better near here thats why only 3 stars,2
i like the new location i have only tried the coffee  pastries so far but both are still excellent monkey bread mmm the new space has a nice cafe feel that looks suitable for just relaxing lunch or a meeting they still have meeting space,3
the place is mainly eh the sashimi tastes like its b quality from the supermarket go to red or unami instead,1
good sushi with a reasonable price takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly,4
i love the margaritas here  i also like the chips and dip  this place is best utilized at happy hour for that reason,2
love this place get corn quesadillas,4
ive lived in 7 different apartments in madison with 6 different landlords and everyone pales in comparison to mcbride need a repair theyve fixed it by the time you get home from work easy to communicate with and they keep the pressure off their customers,4
the pizza here is like the kind you buy in the freezer section of a grocery store and seriously id rather eat frozen pizza than have pizza here again,0
this place is ok  shoes must be taken off before you come inside  staff was really really friendly and that was nicennnrooms are right by the kitchen which can be annoyingnoisy  also gets freezing in here at night,2
a while back the two marigold owners started a seemingly madison revolution in cuisine and ive loved going ever since  i love the care they take with the food and the fun and friendly atmosphere  if only it werent so chaotic and crowded but why should i think such a great place wouldnt get noticed,3
if you want the perfect breakfast well this is it  its so busy because its delicious,4
choas complete and total choas  people crashing into each other food falling on the floor drinks spilled constantly the food was good but the place was horribly managed or better yet completely unmanaged no thanks not again tried the zucchini pancakes and they were good experience was awful,1
the food and service are both very good i do however wish they where open later on weekdays with me being a 3rd shifter the options can be somewhat limited  i do appreciate that they have no problem calling when the driver arrives,3
speaking as someone who does not eat meat eververy often i am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited  i am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection if  i lived closer id hang out here,2
great meat selection best in madison hands down,4
best chinese food in madison  by far friendly staff and quick service  they carry a wide selection of both traditional chinese food and american chinese food,4
hands down most authentic asian cuisine my hubby andi have found in madison  congee love the chicken was moist and tasty so good,4
the only reason why i go to this place is because its the nearest korean restaurant to madison college campus  i always go for their bibimbap on rock which is the best meal there in my opinion  the potato side is really good too,1
nice to see that panera is the same here in madison wi good quality food very nice employees this is a fairly busy location but they move people through rather quickly,3
great vibe with too many great choices i had the frarattoo and would highly recommend it very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg great baked goods as well,4
most know rosatis for pizza and take out but they have so much more including an eat in dinning room  there pizza is great but you also need to try the ribs and fries chicago hot dogs and pastas  they have dinning room specials every night that are an incredible deal,4
hearts topping and not even worth it food was surprisingly bad i had pork and mac grill cheese which didnt work on many levels my sons chicken fingers were better than my dish,1
so funny i just read the previous review  i am in the same boat ie i have been known to drive from chicago to madison to see nicole  i have been unable to replace her   her cuts and colors are consistently good  nnshe is great and was recently promoted to manager kudos she deserves it,4
went for dinner with mother and uncle all three meals where all right but not amazing the quality to price ratio was off too expensive my meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked wine was good,1
i love the selection of baked goods and breakfast treats for work   ive never had lunch or eaten heresomeday soon will have to try it,3
just go to st vinnies on willy street ive worked for this goodwill and they really dont do all that much good will compared with the awesome vinnies whose prices and selection are far better i like my clothes sorted by size and not color too donate and shop at the far better option,0
this copps is near my work  what can you say its part of a huge grocery chain  they have a decent selection of beer and wine at good pricesthe reasons i stop here on my way home  it can get really busy after work especially on fridays,2
this place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful  i guess i hit bad staff day or somethingngood prices and a great selection   nneed chairs to sit and read,2
worst cheesy breadsticks ive ordered this item from other locations and it was great but this locations version was terrible they were over cooked cut in half  and with 50 less bread sticks than other locations barely any cheese as well,0
it was average not quite the same as italian delis in chicago but ok i guess,2
good cheap fast friendly best fresh chips and salsa,4
mmmm mmmm good  the catfish was our favorite but everything was soooo good  get the cornbread,4
i have been going to parkway for years i really like the parkway omelette the service is always fast and friendly what are you waiting for,3
this is a nice little grocer  i wish their cash register would work better so that you dont have to wait 10 minutes to ring up  but otherwise its nice,2
they announced today they are closing as you can see due to my previous review i am not surprised sad but not suprised,0
whenever we go there we are hit with a bill of nearly 200 or more they charge excessivley for small things like looking at some sample under a microscope for 5 mins or 20 for shampoo we are seriously considering switching,1
they charge too much care is soso  i would go to veterinary emergency service  i wish i could do it all over again  they will also suggest you take the route that is most expensive and prey on your feelings towards our pet  stay away,0
checked into our room and went with kids to the pool the hot tub had black water in it no kidding you couldnt see the bottom of the tub the water smelled disgusting like smelly feet how can staff not know what is going on in their hotel  we wont be back,0
3 dart machines a foosball a shuffleboard wouldnt call this a place for games upstairs opens at 11 whats up there thats not open at 9 but as a bonus drinks are cheap staff is friendly great job,1
its tiny and dingy but they sell everything youd need to make a thai curry or whatever asian dish youre trying to make their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area the only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min parking,3
if they hadnt changed their location it was a sureshot 5 stars the old location inside university square mall was just awesome the food was unbelievably tasty and cheap the foods still good but the price is slightly higher now given the nicer location id give it a try if im in the vicinity,3
i love this place  ive been going to paisans since i was about 10 years old  the best is a porta salad and then going on to the bella pizza with onions  best pizza ive ever had,3
was here for a work dinner event  service was not good  very slow too  worst service ive gotten here  usually gotten better service,2
service was extremely slow and not very usefulnever once asked if we wanted something to drink just brought water out took a hour for a 9 pizza that didnt even have all the correct toppings on it food was meh,0
a nice list of loose leaf teas which are served in a lightbulb looking glass ware this jiffy lube converted place is an unexpectedly pleasant coffee shop on the s park street very friendly staff a fantastic view of copps and overall a charming neighborhood cafe,3
its a decent place but the food is hit or miss ive had some great food as well as some really lousy stuffonce my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week oldnok to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood but i wouldnt travel much for it,2
i was a regular at nams till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price  k23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite  but this place does not appreciate customer loyalty so please dont bother going there,1
always a consitent great meal  the service is excellent  weve always had really friendly staff  i love the beat salad and the mushroom pasta special served only at lunch,3
this is our favorite take out place  the food is always fresh flavorful and plentiful  the owners are very nice also  we drive out of the way for take out from them,4
the only thing irish about this irish pub is they sever guiness and have jameson whiskey otherwise there isnt anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all boooring,1
good docs  young but nice and responsive to questions  the office staff isnt the most pleasant  nthe prices are reasonable and the facility is new  very nice,1
monkeyshines is the way to end a night of bad decisions,1
this is one of my favorite west side eats  i highly recommend the veggie spring rolls and the number 60  the number 65 i think this is it it is lemongrass chicken with eggroll  i cant order anything else because i love these,4
easily my favorite restaurant in madison very attentive waitstaff ive never had a dish here that i didnt like,4
crappy vegetarian selection the few things i had were meh definitely needs better labeling for the buffet for noobies like myself,1
grade cnnthe most overrated restaurant in madison decent food outrageous prices good service how this place is still in business amazes me,2
one of our favs in madison very consistent and good sisterinlaw and motherinlaw were impressed last night,3
grade cnnless than average service almost okay food spendy,2
the wash was quick and fairly inexpensive 10 yes they missed a few spots on the dash but the rest of the car was vacuumed nicely and the outside looks great perhaps my expectations were low given the other reviews but id go again,3
worst car wash i ever got the inside of my car is still dirty and dusty doesnt even look like i got a car wash should of gone to octopus what a waste of 20 dollars,0
to keep it short they make consistently great coffeenni would recommended the royale which is a double shot i also bought a mocha for a friend who really enjoyed it as wellnnonly downside for a college campus coffeeshop the prices are high and the sizes are smallnngreat for a time to time treat,3
by far the best place for breakfast in cu and their coffee is always top notch ive never had any qualms with the service and never waited for over 5 minutes for a seat everyones super friendly and i always leave in a great mood,4
love the look and feel of the place but ive eaten better food came here for breakfast and it was alright nothing great the service here was fantastic,1
we had lunch there on a sunday pretty busy ni say the food is ok not a wow but oknthe service was good and the place looked pretty clean nthey got lots to pick from nwe did wait a long time for are foodnthe prices are not to bad either ni will give them another try maybe for dinner,2
i went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care i recievednnfree coldpacks and condoms what more could you ask for,3
overratedn expensiven hipstersnnthree strikes and youre out caffe paradiso,1
its hard to evaluate the merits of a coffee shop based on a french soda but this place seems pretty good it cost about 3 which is a bit pricey but tasted good and the syrups they use are good qualitynnid have to keep going here and grab a coffee to see how the place is on the whole,2
one of the worse chocolate fraps it was bitter to syrupy and overpriced i do not recommend this place,1
i just have to update this to say that they no longer have a minimum for credit card purchases  love their spinach and feta croissants,4
i took my ccw class here and the instructor was very knowledgeable  no complaints here and he made me a more accurate shooter  what more could you ask for,3
i would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids this is a no frills airline nothing special there was no tv period on our 5 hour flight from ny all the kids in the plane were going nuts the seats are very cramped and small the plane seemed very old nngo delta if you have kids,2
dont ever fly us airways to hawaii the flight attendants were rude and very unpleasant spend the extra and fly hawaiian airline,0
i like us airways because they simply fly where i go,2
the worse airline evergod forbid if they buy aa they will also screw that airline up forever also,0
flight attendant spilled water on my macbook pronfried itni work from homenit is my livelihoodnairline wont pay for it ncites we dont pay for electronics ni want my machine replacednnow,0
here is a recipe for success  take the two worst airlines in the industry and merge them together  what do you think you get  one colossal airline that completely sucks,0
so im here every other week seems like and i havent had any problem with us airways,2
i didnt like this place at all i came with 3 friends and non of us like there omelets there were very dry tasting,0
buzzzzzzz in my room all night long coming from the vents creepy clicking speaker in the ceiling construction noises like a drill sting during the day i can hear my neighbors talk avoid at all cost,0
25 standard chinesennill start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix but a senior in my office was heading there so of course i had to go the food is standard chinesecornstarch fare though im sure there is a saving chefs specialty dish,1
this place used to have really good food now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts i think its over priced for what you getnnive always had good service here,2
when i want a fast food burger the jack sirloin burger is my goto chez jack hits the spot en route to or from a night of revelry this jack was fast and friendly cant ask for more,2
the jazz pianist is fantasticnnotherwise the food sucks  the place just creeps me outnnbottom line great piano music does not make a great restaurant,0
very impressed first time there and they had some extraordinary art especially the dancing swarm of fireflies by yayoi kusama  that was worth the price of entry alonennice to have arcadia farms there too,4
i have been to 2 cultural festivals here it is a great venue for showcasing food and cultural performances nparking can be steep at the garages nearby if you cannot find it for free on the street,2
went today to drop off camaro i rented returned quick and easy and picked up new car for 2nd stage of my vacation picked up rt challanger fast and easy once again hertz a,4
horrible service 1 attendant checking in cars at least 20 cars waiting at any point in time we had to wait over 15 mins to get checked out customer service representative was rude when i asked nicely if they could get more attendants out,0
killer little sandwich spot they used to have a deli downtown but now just do sandwiches and pasts fresh bread killer italian meats and super fresh veggies im itchin to try some of the pasta dishes they have but this is the spot for a rockin italian sandwich,4
i followed jillian to volr salon and i love it there jillian always has creative new colors and styles for me to try out i leave feeling beautiful every time and i get many compliments on my hair everyone wants to know where i get my hair done and i always point them to jillian at volr,4
i like miracle mile better we had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 2800  who charges 218 for a drink they were cheap on the bbo,1
yummmmm everything was tasty the koolaid took me back wish we had saved room for red velvet cake,4
next time im in phoenix this is my first stop i ordered the lo los with a side of green beans and corn bread wow i love that southern cooking the sweet tea was amazing and at how many places can you order koolaid on tap,4
my wife ate at lolos brought home a dinner for me chicken dinner the chicken was dry and over cooked no taste  this dinner is not cheap for the money not worth it,0
i liked this place  the ambiance is nice and the service is superb  the mojito was delicious and so was the waffles  my daughter was excited by the red velvet pancakes  the down side was price  so expensive  an order of pancakes was 13  i cant afford to frequent this place very often,2
horrible service burger cooked wrong and it took 20 minutes to get it replaced definately not a place to visit if you have less than 2 hours for lunch  entree prices good but 3 for regular ice tea,0
pretty nice theatre great vibes here,3
best french fries in phoenix  hands down order the parmesean garlic fries and any burger on the menu and you wont be dissapointednnwed nights they run a 5 burger special for one of their burgers but you need to ask them about their special  nncool localind resturant for wine and good food,4
wanted to try this place out went last night and it has been closed down  nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state,0
highly recommend caroline for eyebrow waxing nice touch great attitude  funnynnhighly recommend not being indian if you want to avoid eyebrow waxing,4
good parking although i am upset i had to pay 1 for my 30 minute parking but thats scottsdale for you nothing is always free even parking ilove all the shops here but they could update the map of the area because they are missing new places that have opened up,4
moved from phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place,4
bad feeling about foods and services we came with 2 women 3 men and 2 kids the waiter fogot to bring the drink for us the beef burn when they fried and used to make the salad,2
great salon excellent prices and you love the work they do  ask for sherry i use her i wont go anywhere else,4
this is a place that exists,2
completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed if you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website,0
sometimes you get the uncomfortable feeling in not being welcome there in some parts of the staff is a little bit rude i i guess you could make the best of it if it was the only place to go but its not,1
just missed them they are closed    i wanted to try the shakes ill go elsewhereni stopped by a second time still was not that inpressed but thats just my taste buds maybe you may enjoy it,0
stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam pretty good pizza nice local little spot we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita both were pretty good maybe next time ill try a sandwich solid 3 stars,2
everyone raves about this place so i tied it it was just ok ive had better and worse i had an italian sub with chips and a drink nothing about the place or sandwich compels me for a return visit,2
the service is ok but the food is not worth it  found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food gross,0
this place serves werner enterprises truck drivers i know cause im one of them its just the basics for what we need ive stayed in worse places so if you like a 5 star hotel go somewhere else its a 2 star maybe a soft 3 star hotel but there are plenty of food places within walking distance,1
rating is for the breakfast the american breakfast with toast eggs hash browns with a choice of bacon or sausage is sooo delicious they make it fresh and usually its a less than 10 minute wait time some day i may try one of the lunchdinner options like the burgers and fries,4
very good mexican food the server was friendly but seemed overworked the chips and salsa was excellent i ordered the machaca chimi and it was very good did not come with rice and beans but was enough food itself i would recommend this to people who want more than chain mexican food,3
the wife and i went to ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood will come back for sure o and thanks to erin that made our time there awesome,3
been here a few times when im in town last time was during phoenix pride i wasnt aware that pride was going on the place was packed and lots of friendly people if you like bears then pay this place a visit on a saturday,2
quite crowded with visitors and very nice music awesome,4
as a follow up to my previous review  the practice manager called me to apologize for the bad experience and remedy the issue  i appreciate that they took the effort to reach to me after the fact and let me know that they would address the bad experience i had,1
i get all my business cards printed here  great fast reliable service  dwight behind the print  counter is the man,4
i live just north of the burger factory its always busy  the menu offers a little bit of everything making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes  nnthe food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite,2
heaven for vegan  nstay away from the meat ngreat desserts ntake the turkish coffee,2
my favorite storenvery pricey even with a student discountnive learned 2 pretend 2 be a ai student and get my windsors there  the ai student store along with prismas ai student store is cheap on culinary kits as well  aaron brothers has better quality brushes,4
sunday afternoon before heading back to the airport was great jack  i met some really nice guys good mix of people and the tacos were good and cheap fun place,3
ew never again,1
love always a favorite,4
nice sized parking lot friendly staff,3
i had a waffle cone with a scoop of peanut butter cup and a scoop of rocky road the ice cream wasnt great the flavors seemed off and the texture was grainy the cone was flavorless and fell apart before i finished the first scoop for the price it didnt really seem worth it,1
another fabulous home style chinese food at the prime chinese if you like combo fried rice it is the best ever,4
this restaurant is a master of understatement from the outside and upon entering it doesnt look like much nas it should be the truth is in the food  foodbest beef and broccoli ive ever had  we are regulars now  simply outstanding,4
best chips anywhere great decor prime corner location and no one else has their specialties xlnt,4
this is my fav mexican spot its authentic a great value and the food always tastes amazing i have always had great service and the staff is very welcoming the chips and salsa are among best ive had and be sure to try green sauce if you get enchiladas,4
really fun place great atmosphere and great food awesome parrots and cool crap everywhere decorated,2
very knowledgeable and helpful i went in for a surety bond and he made it very easy and even provided useful tips to help me out definitely going to be getting insurance here when my policy is close to an end,4
i wouldnt advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy huge tacos with frybread wrappers   hit it upnnthe ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fairnni felt like a peace pipe afterwards no really okay no i didnt but it was really good,2
saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table wont go back,1
250 per item and if you dropoff before 900 am your stuff will be done by 400 pmnngood basic dry cleaner that doesnt charge you an arm and a leg just to get your clothes cleaned and pressednncash only  but if you forget they have an atm in the lobbynnrecommended,3
after numerous attempts to resolve and promises to refund prepayment  and no apology my money was refundedtwo months later thanks hertz for ensuring my entire experience was poor back in phoenix this month going straight to enterprise,0
great place to go on a monday afternoon there were probably less than 20 cars in the parking lot i was kind of leery at first because the mall here is sketchy at best but this was a nice clean theater with friendly staff,3
after flying across the country we were hungry and as ive done in many other cities i went in search of pho  nni ordered the pho dac biet  the broth was not oily and packed with flavor  the noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon,4
great foodfriendly serviceand very reasonable  try some of their fresh lemonade instead of byob,4
i go here at least 1 a week with my wife  i get the meatball pho along with the bbq pork bahn mi  the food is great cheap and quick  the staff is friendly not in your typically way but they do a good job  da vang has become of my favorite places period in phoenix,4
this place is fantastic  every time i go i try something different  the family who owns cooks and serves at da vang are very attentive give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one  love love love,4
great staff awesome eatin or take home experience  fish sauce to die for  the best vietnamese food in the valley,3
closed      nnthis jbs location with its poor building layout poor service  mediocre food finally folded  good riddance,1
same 3 star food as any other location but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go,1
thirteen places that sell shoes run down small hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder do yourself a favor and skip this mess,1
great for a dive bar  plus they have 99 cheese burgers during nfl games  dark and dingy like a good diver bar should be  always a great place to stop off at the end of the night  typical bar food  nnthe big negativeno draft beer,2
went in for a couple of drinks with the girls good and cheap drinks daily specials going on they have 4 pool tables  video games and juke box you cant get bored chilling with a group of friends shout out to the bartender the food was alright too over all a chilled place,2
very typical strip mallish take out joint nothing special at all service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out asap food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good,1
great pizza and pitas these guys are right down the street from work and we bring back lunch to the office about twice a month fresh ingredients lots of cheese cant go wrong if you are showing up around lunch 11301230 it will be busy,3
the food is ok average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1 we ordered the chicken quesadilla and was charged 1 more than posted she said she couldnt do anything and didnt credit the difference based on that they get a 2,1
good food good price good service,3
ive been coming to la piu00f1ata for years and it is consistently delish rice and beans are a deciding factor for me and theirs are yum ive never had anything not good do yourself a favor and ask for the hot salsa,4
decent food the pizza is really cheap and when i got it i realized why it was so cheap not that great the reason i gave my mommas 3 stars is for there amazing homemade pies if you get a slice its huge looks like half of a pie would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley,2
went to drive thru smh horrible customer service the girl made a rude comment after i changed the size of my blizzard so rude if you dont like your job leaveeee,1
best to stick to the apple pie  the breakfast  especially the sausage is reflective of the prices cheap,1
historic institution filled with the coolest cars youve ever seen great service good prices cool guys 5 s,4
i think the dim sum was pretty good but their service was alright  for some reason they seemed pissed off when they were pushing the dim sum cart,3
the worse service,0
another disappointing experience  why can they make good al pastor tacos dont even use real corn tortillas the only good thing was the horchata,0
pricing was very competitive compared to 5 other companies  great work and clean up  it took them two days instead of 1 day as estimated to remove two 40 high pine trees  i would use them again if the need arises,3
i really love this place they make the best greek salad ever the customer service is wonderful they are prompt with my order and the food tastes better each and every time,4
their prices are getting out of control  for salad  dudes your dinner prices are getting exorbitant  at these rates the premium items like the proteins should be included with the meal   sorry sweet tomatoes you just priced yourself out of the ballpark  back to soupersald  just crazy lately,1
horrible service and food worst beef enchilada i have ever had even i know mexican rice doesnt have peas and corn in it and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can this is not considered real mexican restaurant in my eyes was definitely a waste of money,0
this hotel was busy during the weekend i visited and at times the front desk was short staffed noise in the rooms from nearby i17 was a problem there are so many hotels in this area ill stay somewhere else in the future,1
outback steakhouse is alright  they have good salads  thats about all i can saynntheir prices are decent if you just want the basic steak mealnnoverall meh  ive experienced better,1
i usually get the sirloin  but the fish dishes arent bad either  steak is always nicely cooked  along with the delicious side dishes  desserts are delicious save some room for them the tally nice thing is that they are consistent,3
steak was about average  pecan salad tasted chemically and not worth the dollar up charge  sweet potato was mushy  i asked for just butter not the extra stuff  she brought out butter and said i put the cinnamon in thought you would like it  so it was so so,2
it was what i expected they packed the box on my two item meal,1
disappointingno heat in the room pet stains on the carpet sink backed upand no one answered the phone when i tried to report these issues on the other hand as mentioned below steve the bartender continues to provide an exemplary level of service that used to be the norm at the crescent,1
went here because my feet were painful and i just could not find comfortable shoes the staff was very knowledgable and helped me pick out some great shoes and an orthotic to help with my foot problem in 2 weeks my feet feel great and i will never go any where else for my feet and shoe needs,4
surprise this place doesnt have many reviews  place stays busyso on with my review  well all i can say is there service is at perfection to me  ive heard and experience the horror storys that happens going to the wrong dry cleaners  trust me that wont happen hear,4
excellent good fresh and delicious with many choices at a great price  you get it made your way with many different choices of meats cheeses and toppings thru also have pastas but i recommend subs they are better,3
i had the best customer service from eric in the fan department today thank you for all your help eric you helped me more than you can imagine i appreciate your customer service hopefully ill see you again for more goodies your co workers were exceptionally helpful as well,4

salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were awful  three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section  so disappointing  either do it right or take it off the menu,1
this is a horrible car wash  the manager  owner is extremely rude and the quality of the work is terrible   i would never waste the money to return here  they only are concerned with up selling detail packages and not with the quality of car washes done,0

driveup ordering box broken for months today at lunch ordered a double del cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers  need i say more off too whataburger,0
we came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in now the guac i get charged extra for is all over the paper and not on my tacos ill go elsewhere moving forward,1
not much to look at inside the building is deceiving from the out side i thought there would be a lot more to look at walked and read the whole place in 3045min,0
pretty good and they deliver the nachos are excellent and they put the cheese sauce in its own container and is more than enough for an extra side of chips most locations are cash only which can be a bummer,3
there is a reason milanos has been in business as long as they have the selection is great and it is one of those few places that you can establish a relationship with the guys working there,4
very professional and friendly to this visitor from cold chicago here for cubs spring training fit me in last minute great wax and pedicure  personalized service highly recommend,3
cranky old man who has been in the business too long if his work product was great perhaps it would be worth it but his results are hit and miss i would not recommend going to this man,0

im not as enthusiastic as the other two reviews but this is above average in terms of food  however the atmosphere is lacking in comparision  it really is a holeinthewall  if you want something different than a chain you may want to consider it,2
one word  awesome,4
not terrible not great may be better to call aheadwe ended up waiting a while and then they had 3 workers working on 6 people they were doing their best but understaffed and too many customers their service probably also suffered a little bit because of it might not have been a good day for them,2
one of my preferred pizza places,3
barros is always awesome when i call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be and their meatball pizza is delicious,4

ordered the bobo platter for an appetizer nthe beef was grey and smelled funny the bbq was vinegar with ketchup and the egg rolls were rock hard all of it was like leftovers from other plates ndefinitely will not go back and will never recommend this divenwish there was a negative star,0

beware beware beware normally i give fairly kind reviews but this place is awful  if you are diet conscious eat here youll have zero appetite after the first bite  yucky food  waitress extremely nice and decent atmosphere but the food truly is inedible,0
sometimes i dont like to go in because it seems dirty and some of the staff looked real tweaked  kind of a nice humidor but dont expect real knowledgeable staff to be of any assistance  i think a raid of this place would turn up some  unmentionables  proceed with a bit of caution,1
small and quaint the servers are friendly food is good coffee is hot even in summer they have decent patronage i  sure the winter will be busy we always like small locally owned business  and we love our breakfast places,3
they need to lay off the ice more than 34 of my drink was full to the top of ice two sips and youre done is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal nope,0

i agree with ricky c  was in albertsons yesterday and also last week pork was 349lb not on sale today it was buy one get one free but the price was 699lb now how is that buy one get one free  no store in the valley charges 699 for pork,0
pizza is great but this place is overpriced for what it is,2
i just felt that the calamari was bland  the roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty  tirimisu was deliscious though,1
40 dollars for sauce dough cheese and sausage  give me a break  my wife and i go out often  this was the worst service i have received in years  over priced hole in the wall pizza joint  we heard good things we were not sure what people see in this place  not for us,1
great donuts a little hard to find but worth the hunt must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters my wife loves the chocolate chip rolls they can also make your next party cake we have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past always excellent,4
great donuts and friendly service i highly recommend  good coffee i have no idea what the guy was complaining about the owners english was fine,4

better than expected the servers were very friendly the chips were fresh and the salsa and meatball soup were incredible nni cant give more than 3 stars yet as the rice salad and margarita were pretty bad we will give them another try as i could live on that soup,2

pricey for what you get pretty good flavor service was ok id say go to elmers right down the street instead,1
ill be honest i was not impressed with the food very in seasoned and greasy service was slow i also received a dirty water glass and silverware this was my first and last visit i give it 2 stars because the cost is low,1

you can find a lot of mediocre mexican food in the valley guedos however does the basics right beans rice tortillas and meat that stand up on their own the tortillas in particular are huge pillowy and delicious the service is always prompt and they never lack for seating,4
the food is good but no better than any other mexican restaurant the prices are ridiculous 350 for one taco probably wont be going here again unless i win the lottery,1
total bait and switch sales department will tell you one price over the phone then quote you another when you arrive happened to me personally 3 times i bought from scottsdale bmw one quote one price done deal buyer beware,0
on the positive side the delivery was quick the egg rolls were burnt tasted like they had been refried the vegetable soup good portion for sure  the cabbage in the soup had black spots all over  i will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time  the last time i will eat there,0

three words bland expensive bland i went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and i ordered crab cakes we were both disappointed and found this place way overrated i think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch,0

omg   graet value  the happy hour here is awesome do try their big ass burger as its the bestnthe ambience service and every  item we ordered was most excellent   inexpensive drinks too  happy hour is first come first serveand busy as the word is out get there early,4
best thai place in old town scottsdale great ambiance and good service the bar was also good nnhad the pad thai noodles with the vegetarian option tasted excellent nnwould highly recommend  this place for people who just want to have a good casual evening,3
food was decent but not amazing while the service was pretty slow  atmosphere was rather stale and uninteresting so id recommend takeout,2
a good place to meet with some friends for some drinks but i agree with the space issue  just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic,2
now offering free towel dry with 3 or 4 which are 8 and 10 your simple and mediocre drive thru car wash at least they arent trying to sell you on much,2
all i can say is wow easily some of the best italian food ive had you certainly get what you pay for the portions are no joke if you are in the mood for a classy delicious italian dinner this is the place to go,4
great night was had with 20 guests have had indian food in parts of az as well as new york and australia this was one of the better places thats for sure staff were friendly and attentive and the meals were served quickly well worth a return visit,4
im all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy its obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21 everything had a thin layer of barf on it,0
sunday nights  metal head and metal head  80s awesomenessnnmy review is based solely on metal head an 80searly 90s rock cover band that rocks martini ranch every sunday night its a cheap 5 cover to get in and a must go,3
i could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers cant count and are douches  will never go back to the place again,0
great ambience okay service boring food food was typical fusion heavy on the pseudochinese influence kind of like a thaiinspired pf changs definitely not terrible but i wont go back,1
service was as good as could be expected  atmosphere was very nice with elegant lighting and smooth jazz playing or spanish guitar thus the fusion  food portions were generous and presented nicely  will definitly frequent this place  thank you  steven,4
love this place great thai food we ordered panang egg rolls thai fried rice and pad thai everything was amazing except the pad thai they use really thin noodles which ive not seen before it wasnt my favorite but everything else was delicious i would definitely go back,3
heard about this place from friends was excited to try it not really impressed food was just flavorful enough to not be bad mehegg rolls were mushy inside sugarcane chicken was ok,2
horrible customer service  no smiles no personality they called me you the entire time i was there  very bad,0
i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat they do have the best chipotle ranch ever,3
one of my favorite restaurants  love the enchantment platter the habenero burger is the hotest hamburger i have ever eaten  its awesome but beware,3
fun building to be in and great fresh mexican food  this place is off the main strip of old town but worth the detour,4
food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar even the guacamole is amazing probably the best quesadilla ive had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need like extra guac great cheap eatery,4
came here on christmas eve because of all the hype the price is an upsale restaurant but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar i didnt think anything was great about the place reminded me of a cafeteria there are far better restaurants in the valley for the price,1
i have been going to don  charlies for years and am amazed how consistant the food and service is love the creamy cole slaw liver seattle salmon and especially the ribs the memoriabelia is a major league plus,4
went to uncle sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends  we had a great time  friendly gracious and efficient service  the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable  we had everything from seafood to chicken  everyone raved about their entree,3
love this place truly one of the best italian restaurants in the valley great ambiance authentic italian food very reasonable priced as well great service,4
i have never had a bad meal at uncle sals this is the type of italian place that has you unbuttoning your pants at the end of your meal and taking left overs home great wine selection too,4
hands down the best neighborhood italian restaurant in az the veal chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing one of the best salads in town as well the bar menu is one of the best deals as well tons of food for not a lot of money they also pour a great glass of wine,4
what a waste of money  i got home and cleaned off all the missed spots and glass that wasnt cleaned  not to mention when i was there i was hassled to upgrade to everything even fixing my windshield wtf,0
do not go here horrible service horrible attitudes stay away,0
wild little place  great cheapass drinks a real shocker in old townnnalways busy late at night and crazy busy on weekendsnnlove it around the holidays  these guys must put up over a million christmas lightsnnthe dive bar of dive bars in scottsdale,3
oldest tavern in scottsdale and still the least scottsdale of any bar in scottsdale   go early go late its always good,4
definite dive bar in scottsdale but fun all the same  the regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment  cheap beer and good people watchingfun place for a saturday afternoon,3
came here for the first time a roach crawled on my arm the first five minutes not a good thing,0
inexpensive been coming here for years and the bartenders are great when u sit on the patio u feel like youre at a ranch some douche does happen here close enough to the border of the land of the lames but still pretty safe parties and grilling happen here often day drinking is a given,2
i heard the music from the sidewalk and wouldnt even walk in what a basic and lame name i did not see any reason to go in there i would rather walk around and listen to andre nickatina,0
place was good very friendly owners menu was good if youre looking to stay with a familiar territory i could defintely tell this was a place many regulars go we found john to be a very nice guy,3
the guy working there was nicentheir food is not great at allnthere is a full bar which is nicenthere is nothing on draft all bottlesnbut they accept credit cards so that is good,2
terrible in every way worse place i have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive  this must be a front to launder money because i dont know how else they stay in business,0
average sushi  young crowd  good happy hour  much better sushi can be had elsewhere but it can be quite the swinging scene if you are into that sort of thing  i used to come here when i was in college if that tells you anything,2
we are huge fans of their reverse happy hour on sundays we get great service and are out of there before the uppity crowd arrives for some foolsnobbery ra is a great sushi staple in the valley,3
overpriced and not even very good they were ok when i didnt know of better sushi options in phoenix,1
awesome lunch specials for crazy cheap  greta sushi as well never had a bad experience,4
in an expensive chichi district but has that neighborhood family restaurant feel the casual outdoor seating with misters makes for a pleasant evening great big margaritas good service and nobody rushes you  food is midrange ok somewhat americanized  not very spicy but solid selection,3
i ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy  it was so not spicy and not flavorful  however i had a nice time inspite of the food,1
love this place for mexican food and margaritas  my fave is their fish tacos but all their food is good  prefer their outdoor patio area to the inside restaurant,3
the food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor i wouldnt call this place authentic as its just a lot of fried food with greasy yellow cheese i do not recommend this for visitors looking for authentic mexican food,1
yummy    very good   wow calzone personal can feed two,4
went here for my birthday with about 12 people and we enjoyed out first experience at grimaldis we had about 45 large pizzas and had a lil leftover to take home but boy was that the best pizza i have ever had a lil bit hard to find but this is my new favorite pizza place,3
you want italian youre no where near new york go to grimaldis ny pizza at its  finest great service great food great venue thank you,4
great reception upon entering and great food  no one will be disappointed unless you are looking for a real fancy place with fancy menus but i bet the food at the italian grotto is better,3
owner is an arrogant prick dont care if the food is good or not but there are too many good restaurants in old town to give this guy your hard earned,0
nice ambiance and good seafood for az would definitely recommend this place waiter also gave us free dessert,3
i concur with several other customers commenting on the owner we frequented this restaurant for years however once we saw the other side of the owner that was it for us  unpleasant and rude is an understatment its not the way we want to spend a nice evening,0
i went there last week it wasnt even busy i waited 15 plus min and no one came to take my order i had to walk out of this joint   it should be ashamed to be have a location on old town and piss people off and run their business like an amateur little kids i hope you guys shut down very soon,0
hopefully they like your song choices or else you will buy drinks while waiting to get your name called the table next to us got here after us and submitted their song choices after us and got to perform before us  geisha go go is better and youll spend the same amount and actually get to sing,1
did not like any of the artphotos on display  is it really art  photos were a bit disturbing but not in a good way,1
me and a friend came here after dinner at the pink pony to have a drink and people watch great service and a pretty center bar to relax id like to come back for dinner here,3
here is the breakdown fresh squeezed oj and goose the salmon  and the filet this is all you need the sides are awesome too im not going to say i have never had a crappy server here but that happens anywhere at times i will give 5 stars for the quality of the food and the reasonable pricing,4
i like bandera the food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and i love the wood smoke flavor the meats have some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick i will keep coming back i love the cornbread appetizer,4
the office max in south scottsdale gets the job done they have a good selection of office products,2
this place is downright awful  the only reason im giving it one star is due to location to old town and the staff were nice  otherwise it would get a negative score  pony up the extra dough and stay at the marriott or hilton youll thank me,0
high end coffee shoppe with a local feel,4
the service is ok but the staff always seem put off or distant,2
the people that work here are amazing all of them theyre not only friendly but they take care things great experience every time,4
this place has the coldest beer in town period and the hottest bar dancing women after 900pm in the planet at midnight the real fun starts but thats a different story best experienced and not told this is a biker super hot spot during arizona bike week,3
this is one of the best bars in town if you have out of town guests bring them to the dirty dogg saloon this place is edgy and fun you and your guests will have a blast watching the girls dance on the bar they play great music and a lot of great people hang out there,4
i love the pizza here i come here all the time with friends the pizza is always delicious and the lunch specials are incredible when it comes to price i have only had a couple encounters with snotty teenage workers but otherwise it has always been great,4
this is a fantastic spot for views  a healthy lunch  love the bento boxesall under 400 calories  delicious  keep it up sanctuary,3
i love roys  almost everything is delicious and the service is top notch  nnthey no longer serve bread and butter  whats up with that,3
i like perusing this place they have many colorful decor items including furniture sculptures furniture fabric bobbing turtlesthe list continues i bought some decorative tiles on here for 1 each these are unique and cheap gifts a good place to go if you want to give someone an arizona present,3
one word nirvana,4
at ritas kitchen restaurant staff is somewhat condescending i got the entre size salad on a dish so small that is difficult to eat out of food is ok expected big hang out place bar area seems to be more popular,2
lovelyswimming in the pool with that amazing view alone is worth the trip   maybe youll be as lucky as i was and a hummingbird will fly next to you to have a drink from the pool heaven no paradise valley,4
beautiful rooms and views room service is awful the tuna tartare was tasteless and my quesadilla was so burnt i had to send it back the room also had a number of technical problems that the staff could not solve such as the tv in the bedroom not functioning overall i wouldnt recommend this hotel,1
a favorite place for more than a decade very consistent and an attentive staff that has been there for years and years,4
we had dessert  coffee here on valentines day  not sure i would normally come here but we specifically came to see the lovely  talented judy roberts on the ivories and were delighted by her vocal accompanist the enchanting margot reed  that duo rocks our socks  judy judy judy,3
the crab cake is the best in town if you order the caesar salad with salmon request it to be blackened game changer if you are into beef go for the marinated flank steak heaven on a fork nnthe bar is very good sized and has full service for food and lots of tvs nnbon apatite,3
great atmosphere great ice cream and burgers friendly staff best dq around looking forward to come back again,4
food and drink are great  service is always really slow for happy hour,2

lons is heaven sit outside at sunset and smell the pinon fires watch the sun go down and enjoy the great food,4

this restaurant is always a treat great food and great service the outside area is a wonderful experience,4
the food is excellent the wait staff is efficient the place is dull  dont go for the vibe  its really really dull,3
we went in for late snacks at about 1200 on a saturday night the waitress was new and ordered us the wrong food and it took for ever to get to our table the food was just okay,1
i was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or talavera pottery nim always looking to add a little something,1
the only thing good was the rice i ordered chow mein noodles noodles this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup called and the guy was a dick if you know chinese food this is not it waste of money i hope they go out of business,0
this place is really bad  not sure how you can have such bad service when its so empty but they pulled it offnnthe food made me sick  i am sure there are no stray dogs or cats in the area because the pork i had tasted like something totally differentnnwill not be back here  what a waste of a meal,0
the chicken and gyro meet are great,3
i enjoy good persian food this place is good  cherry rice misses the mark but everything else is tasty very affordable too,3
great tasting persian food the quality of food is just great,3
delicious  got seats within five minutes of arriving service was topnotch and atmosphere was great  portions are huge can definitely get one order for two peoplennnot an ideal place for kids but perfect for dates family gatherings or any special occasion,4
not sure if this has changed hands but the gyro i got had minimal meet at best big dissatisfaction wont be back,0
best place to eat in az,4
good gym overall filled with a few meatheads and people posing for competitions but they dont bother anyone and provide some entertainment i appreciate that the trainers are independent and you arent haggled to sign up for a session with them they are just there if you need them,3
i like it for the selection of beers however i hate the bar itself i would rather go to total wine and bring my beers back nn4 stars for the selectionn2 for the shitty bar atmospherenn3 average,2
the orange blossom beer is great and the staff is friendly enough however waiting 2 hours for your food is unacceptable and i would only recommend this place to people who want to hang out for a while and drink beer,0
ive been to papago and handful of times and love the lowkey tavern like environment i have only tried their orange blossom beer it is tasty i want to go back and try their food,2
i have to say i really enjoyed getting my nails done here and they did a great job however it did not appear clean that really bothered me the glass on the front counter was so dirty it almost looked frosted sorry girls good work but you need to do a little spring cleaning,2
without a doubt one of the best and most friendly places in town the filet is the best and most tender friendly staff and seller service dont miss it,4
should be 3  10oz filet 48 presentation looked good sauce on the ribs and chicken was a little thick salads were very good and so was the bread,2
expensive  problem with this place is that a guy with super greasy hands took my keys and my got in my car yup you guessed it grease all over my door handle shifter steering wheel car keys just disgusting  will never go back,0
first they dont have change of hundred second they attend at other costumers before of my when i show first and i recive my food 40 minutes latenme gustaba mucho pero creo no vuelvo fui su cliente por mas de 8 au00f1os,0
i dont understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines two weeks was what i was informed that it would take to fix my unit i followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they havent even started working on it,2
seriously woohoo as good as it gets the world would be a better place if all the stores treated their customers the way they do at bobs bike shop dale is absolutely awesome,4
one of my favorites ive been there twice and got the soft shell crab which was exceptional  the oysters are very good too for apppetizers and so is the manhattan clam chowder it looks very small from the outside but the restaurant is underground,4
this place has awful customer service and a bad attitude it was like being in eastern europe where attendants think they are doing me a favor by selling me something no thanks i wont be back meditate on that,0
last night i went for the healing circle with rev jimmy  it was amazing staff was helpful  i didnt have the sleep he said i would but i definitely feel more at peace today  i am thankfulnnpeace and blessingsnronney,3

this place is the best place for italian deli sandwiches in all of phoenix but located in scottsdale the bread is incredible its definitely an institution just go,4
this little gem is tucked away just north of mcdowell on 87th st nnthe owner and workers are fabulous and fun they have more in the back that you dont see because its tiny they also have a constant stream of people coming through theyre certainly doing something right,3
rude rude rude i came back here because i had a flat tire i could not believe the poor service and how long it took i have  always bought my tires from this location and raved about them im not sure what happened this time maybe it was because they werent selling me new tires i wont be going back,0
always will get my tires at discount service and prices pretty much are hard to beat the staff is always helpful friendly and knows tires highly recommend them,4
for a membership only place this place was very sub par the food was something i would expect from a local dive bar not a country clubnnthe only redeeming factor is the view of the coursecamelback and the strong drinks from a limited bar,2
these guys did a radiator flush for me a few days ago  the manger was the one that helped me  he was fantastic,4
been going to this car wash for a few years now it gets slower and slower every time sat in waiting area for an hour last time not going back 15 workers and its terrible,0
there coffee is indeed good  dont count on using their wifi though it sucks  when it is working rarely it is completely unusable  heres a thought invest 30 dollars in your business and get a halfdecent wifi router with 80211n support  nncmon,0
ace is always more expensive than other places but the folks there sure are helpful and know what they are talking about,2
this place it is not a buffet and will not honor the 15 stays the contract has expiredtherefore will not do it overprice and unfriendly customer service,0
i went for their lunch buffet and was expecting a buffet it was a few dishes and the honey chicken turned my mouth into a glue trap havent been back since,1
okay i love oregenos and wrote glowingly about rays and nypd a few days ago but this is not them it is something i crave every so often so i really need to learn to fight these urges  ugh,2
super expensive half this stuff you can get online for 34 cheaper the people who work here are also pretty rude and almost none of them are knowledgeable about their products its like they get their stock from adamandevecom and then hike up the price 60,1
they have a decent selection but make sure to look at the expiration dates of the condoms you buy here they frequently sell expired condoms or at least condoms with incorrect expiration dates i have better luck buying condoms at gas stations watch out,1
went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed both of the bagels that were ordered were burnt to a crisp see posted photo we got the bagels to go so we didnt notice until we got home really disappointed,0
this is probably the worst einsteins ive ever been to and it sucks to write this because i am a huge fan of them but the one on campus always gets my order wrong the bagels are not fluffy and theyre tasteless and the staff are slow not going back to that one ever again,1
terrible customer service did not answer their phone when i called for the status of my truck i was quoted one price and charged more never called when my vehicle was done would not recommend this place to anyone,0
ra is the worst place to go for sushi,0
happy hour is the only time i come here but for good reasonnyou can get 3 rolls for 15 without a doubt my favorite place to get sushinnrated a 4 instead of 5 because of the obnoxiously loud music  ask for the patio if you can brave the heat,3
it was nothing special slow service by tiny ladies the potatoes we had with brunch were not so good and the menu selections were skim and did not show much originality however my girlfriend loved the smoked bacon,1
quality beer decent food good atmosphere all at a reasonable price  a great place to enjoy a pint with some rock climbing friends from the phx rock gym httpwwwyelpcombizphoenixrockgymtempe,3
beer is awesome first timers must do the beer flight sampler and i have never had a meal that wasnt excellent   a quick note there isnt ac in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months  although that doesnt stop anyone from going the place is always jumping,4
i liked the food here and the service has always been good  ive been here for lunch with coworkers or to watch a game with friends  no difference in quality at any time,2
ive always had a great experience with this place,4

needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in tempe area overall i like the music atmosphere is amazing customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy love the burgers,3
amazing patio at night perfect for relaxing i love that it is in the heart of tempe but doesnt feel like it the veggie burger  kiltlifter are heavenly the oatmeal stout is perfect for winter,4
goog food  great brew  a bit hot inside this place  tvs are small to watch the game  bathrooms are dirty,3
cant go wrong with their ipa,2
i use to enjoy this place but i just had a bad experience for lunch i even heard my server talking to his colleagues about how bad the tip was from the previous table also they were out of the first two beverages that i asked for  will not be going back anytime soon,1
love the complimentary corn break i had pork tenderloin which was good the mashed potatoes werent impressive though bf had the ahi it was pretty yummy came with rice pilaf which werent very flavorful nnmy mango mojito tasted like fruit juice bf liked the margaritas though,2
the cornbread rocks it every time  it sort of reminds me of thanksgiving corn casserole  and its freenni recently had the chili relleno and it was tasty but could have been heated up a bit more,3
scale of 110 single visitn7 foodn9 servicen7 atmospheren7 value,2
makes me hungry for innout,1
a solid place to get a freshly prepared burger i like their onion rings also,2
great shop  i cant 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service  slow is better when doing mods  this aint jiffy lube,4
great salads and their fries and chips are to die formy friends love their grilled cheese not on the menu and ive always had awesome service great place for lunch and a good beer,3
we had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8  the service was very slow  the server was forgetful  and the chicken california flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning,0
the food is excellent but the service is horrible  if the service was even just ok id give them 5 stars,0
holy cow best chorizo is right glad i checked the yelp reviews i made fabulous breakfast burritos  killer burgers from the chorizo this is my new jam 4 chorizo  tortillas,4
i totally understand this is a hate it or love it place well i love it its really small so no matter where you stand you have a good view and the sound system is pretty good drinks are reasonably priced and made really strong which is nice get some preshow pizza its really yummy for 3 bucks a slice,4
yikes i completely forgot about the fact that my boyfriend found a big black hair in the food close to when we were almost finished eating how could i have forgotten that nnas delicious as the food was that can never happen when you are running a restaurant super gross,2
pretty solid ethiopian food my only comparisons are chicagobased but this was a nice find this is really lateso i hope theyre around and still serving the same i had  it was awesome,3
hidden charges flavorless sauce crust wasnt cooked long enough and they delivered the wrong toppings,0
ive had this a few times since  delivery takes forever customer service is god awful  seriously these people are such assholes  you get what you pay for and this place is still a ripoff  should never be more than a star,0
its funnyi had heard that gus had good pie  all i can say is it must taste really good when youre under the table  when you are sober its pretty medicre pizza folks even if they do deliver at 3am,1
one of our old standbys friendly service great food and not too pricey  we always seem to get the spring rolls gai co cuan and beef with noodle bowls bun bo nuong and i love the homemade lemonade,3
oh god yesnnthe pho tai here is pho king incrediblennbest in the pho king valley,4
great pho and fast service,3
decent vietnamese food tried their bun cha hanoi and it was lacking a little flavor and the meat was slightly drier than i would liked but more than edible liked that they didnt skimp on any of the dishes since the portions were huge decent prices for somewhere other than little saigon,3
breakfast all day healthy portions  tiny diner but food was very fast   no substitutions and no amex,2
other than a couple waitresses with big jugs this place doesnt have much to offer the food is bland and over priced only positive thing i can say is that that they warm up their muffins,1
great for breakfastbrunch delicious and hardy meals we were served extremely fast and the atmosphere was fun,3
the corned beef hash comes from a can and includes an extra side of hashbrowns  yes that means hashbrowns served with hashbrowns  are these people dumb,0
chipped beef on toast corned beef hash biscuits and gravy and eggs maximillion all excellent,4
this place is too trendy  it tries to pack in the newestcoolestgreen items and leaves little room for the glass  as one reviewer even statedall  glass pieces are shunned to the back of the store  again too trendy for me  this is a lifestyle choice not a fashion statement,1
common eat spot for my work peeps people literally fly in for the big rigg i somehow always order and pay for a cookie but never see it though suppose its just some sort of karmic fat tax,3
this bar transport from iowa city is all over the valley but unlike the iowa version i feel it has no redeeming qualities bad food and funny tasting tap brews girlfriends fake id got stolen there man having a girlfriend under the drinking age sucks im glad thats over,1
took forever to get tab felt ignored,0
this place is closednnot sure why yelp hasnt updated the information yet,0
this place is pretty trashy id rather smoke my hookah at home,1
fun little concert venue with indoor and outdoor stages  they have hop knot on tap which makes me happy  would not ever have a mixed drink there again howeverthere is something really off in the flavor of their fountain soda,2
good tandoori chicken  skip the bland lamb curry  spinach curry was delicious eat it with basmati rice  excellent samosas  heavenly gulab jamun  the carrot squares were delicious as well  wash it all down with chai  9 lunch buffet  cant wait to try again,2
the tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry the chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty they serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice,2
love to rock climb but the staff at this gym were extremely rude and impatient wont be going back here because of them,1
nans and non veg curry was goodloved the custard fruit saladbiryani was not up to expectationgod knows about veg foodlamb curry was good,2
very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning,1
rula bula has an excellent menu i recommend the rosemary salmon salad great beer selection boddingtons and wonderful service the staff here is superb and delightfulyy quirky and i love the irishgaelic music it serves as a great workweek lunch reprieve,3
favorite restaurantbar on mill by far even if youre not a fan of the irish youll enjoy their foods their irish chips kind of like potato frieswedges are amazing and so is their irish french dip great irish pub atmosphere a little more mellow than most mill bars great outdoor barpatio,4
good vegan junk food  honestly stay away from the healthiersounding items  most of it that ive had tastes nowhere near as good as the saucedrenched fried seitan sandwiches,3
the food is good  they put a little thought into their offerings  if you like meat i recommend you avoid the mock no matter the form mock does not taste like chicken  if youre a mock eater you already know greennnmike,2
i love green every time i visit either at the tempe location or in downtown phoenix i am blown away by how good they make meatless options yummy also the green in downtown phoenix now has alcohol sign me upnncheers,3
i love the food at green ive tried many other vegan restaurants in the valley and green is by far my favorite please consider opening a chandler location i would be able to go way more often,4
im not vegan or even vegetarian but this place is delicious ive been here a few times and got a couple different sandwiches and one of their bowls and everything ive had was really good ill take their big wac over a big mac any day,4
stopped by with my son after the zoo  clean friendly and the food was good  portions are quite large so definitely a great value for the price  we will return,2
good neighborhood sports bar friendly staff and good management enjoy the pingpong n bags games for outside patio,2
this place has zero customer service they lost my clothes after i confirmed they had them the owner looked at me and told me there was nothing to do she is miserable do not go here,0
one of the more crowded and more popular places on mill but sometimes it will take 1015 min to get a drink fun place to play some pool and have a few drinks the long islands are strong and will make your knees loose after a few overall not too bad of a place but just short of 4 stars,2
great food the tadiq is my fav love the cornish hen also the kabob and steak kabob are awesome yummy,4
we went there with high hopes  but got disappointmentnmany of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice even meat items had no taste we felt it too costly for the quality we gotndesserts were okay,0
they always take great care of our little girls even though one of them is not very friendly to other dogs they give meds frozen treats and for extra will offer play time and more treats i especially like the report card they give you at pick up,4
use to stop by for the cheaper gas fell in love with soda fountain,4
everything ive ordered from here has been pretty good i will often stop here when i dont feel like cooking and the food comes out fast the atmosphere isnt the greatest but id youre doing take out that shouldnt be an issue,3
this place is great  i have a flock of chickens and they need food  tempe feed and tack is close to my house of course i live in tempe and the people are super helpful and friendly  they always load up the 50lb bags of feed and i never have to wait,4
three words  food borne illness  frankly their food isnt tasty enough to warrant the risk,0
friendly wait staff  authentic ingredients  however the shawarma are nothing like i had in kuwait  the shish kabob is worth getting   basmati rice needs some work   the market next door is great,2
we were planning to eat elsewhere before but since they were full we decided to eat at mbgfr we were seated right away and our server was very nice and attentive we started off with the hummus i think jalapeno and then each got our own chicken souvlaki pita everything was aok and ill probably return,2
great meeting place for a family dinner friend get together or to use the big room upstairs for a party really good skinny margarita their salsa is a little watery the street chicken tacos are really good,2
theyve just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling i mean not really there for cyclists everything is an argument the work they do sucks they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit but only just better,1
this is mostly for the imaging center ngreat service love the staffngreat rates on processingngo shoot some film and get it done here,3
the food was good beans are delicious however portions are too small compared to black bear where i usually do breakfastthe service was ok,1
eh pretty much just your average mexican jointnnive been there twice and the first time was very good 2nd time just averagenni highly recommend the green chile tamale while the rice and bean burro was just blehnnnothing special except for the price dinner for two with tax and tip was 21,2
ive been going to lafondas for about 20 yrs on and off had cheese enchiladas today with rice and beansvery salty not sure if the salt was in all the dishes or just onebut almost too salty to eat nalso had a fish taco which was very good i think i like macayos betternb,2
the desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size  ive had better japanese bakery items elsewhere,1
banana shake and seasoned fries nnstick with that and you are good to go,2
hard to complain fast service good prices,2
nice small cafu00e9 shop with machine sales on the sidenbut as for coffeenot many choices  tasted bad,0

i have used ahr mechanical for 5 years and while the maintenance service has been good when a leak happened in one of my ac units i had to wait 5 days for it to be repaired  the cost for the 1 hour repair was 116500  definitely overpriced for the work involved,2
low prices for an eclectic selection,4
attended a seminar here the rooms were spacious and catering for breakfastsnacks and lunch was good the parking lot here is fairly large so finding a space isnt too much of a problem,2
fantastic food for fantastic prices from chicagoan point of view and the service could not have been better the pear  brie fremch toast was unique  delicious,4
this place probably has a delicious full menu but i wouldnt know the prime rib and the filet mignon is so succulent and yummy that i have not bothered to try anything else,3
a pricey dateoriented eatery with fantastic ambiance  i only ate outside and found the vibe to be great but the food a little short of what i would expect for what theyre charging  however i can see it being an ideal place to bring a date and go through a bottle of wine or two,2

its a dive but i swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich i have ever had  we used to come here a couple times of week when i was in college  the bbq sauce is to die for  and it is so cheap,3
loved the food but ive had a hard time going back as they only take cash,2
my number one food choice is a hamburger outstanding burger with no frills i like going to a place for the food and keeping the price in line if i want ambiance i will go to a traditional restaurant this has been around for years so it has stood the test of time i cant wait to go back,4
one word  awesomenif youve never ate  a burger at the chuck box then you havent really had the best burger ever made periodnnits a must for me to eat here once more before i leave  az,4
this store is expensive dirty and basically a place to walk to when youre too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer,0
the food was disappointing to say the least the panang was extremely watery the sweet and sour chicken which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong was mostly vegetables light on the chicken and the chicken pad see you spelling is way off was extremely dry,0
very disappointed ordered chicken pad thai to go and i didnt notice until i got home that they put tofu instead of chicken the flavor was very plain there wasnt even peanuts in it dont recommend,2
they have some variety of stock that you may miss from india in navratri festival  i went there to collect saindha salt and swang ke chawal which i didnt find in other stores in tempe  arizona the owner mahesh arora uncle is very good and courteous n5 stars for good service and stuff i needed,4
i am not one for a college bar hangout  i have been brought here several times and i have to say that those several times have been lacklusternnthe food was good bar fare with giant portions  i havent tried the oysters yet soonnnmy rec is go here for a late 2 martini lunch,2
great place on sunday afternoon and sitting outside ill be a regular,3
my all time favorite bar of all time i frequent here at least 34 times a week i have been doing that for about 4 years now i will never stop coming here amazing drinks food beer selection and most off all the staff keep it up caseys,4
i stopped here for gas and lunch one day the employees are very friendly fast and great with small talk and i had no issues with my sandwich but i can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich,3
fish dish was decent but really salty  didnt like the taste of the broccoli the green beans were very good,1
our waiter jason was great however i was not a big fan of the hokey pokey dance the staff had to do  it was a bit loud but it helped drown out the sound of the man behind me hacking up a lung it was high energy and a nice change,2
tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mallnnwe were both very disappointed the food was absolutely terrible neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left nni can in no way recommend this location and suggest going somewhere else,0
a bit dissappointing  i have no idea how anybody would rate this place higher than a 35  for those with a 55 what are you thinking  all i can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp,1
rent affordable accepts dogs of all sizes and breeds staff is friendly quiet neighborhood,4
ill say this club is very fancy nice bathrooms everything looks great but i paid 9 for a bud light draft that is kinda said ended up leaving after one hour was not all impressed by the girls two on a stage at a time no draft beer go somewhere else unless youre wanting to spend your whole paycheck,1
we survived inspite of the stale food several items on the buffet were just plain stale not sure how these guys are in business,1

my wife and i went to the waterfront tonight had a few drinks and appitisers the coconut  shrimp is awesome has some great habanero seasoning with the salad side it was a lot of fun sitting outside looking over the lake and having a beer very nice place good food good atmosphere great staff,4
positive fast and accurate service close to my office nnnegative nothing ever tastes right the fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture the chili is served the wrong side of warm,1
super friendly staff they made my out of town drop in feel like home huge studio that can fit up to 100 students,4
this is the worst einstein ever i go to my normal local einstein and in comparison this place is like going to a 7 eleven never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in,0
ive been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is meh the bbq sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste the rib tip platter is ok nothing to get too excited about this place meh ive experienced better,1
we eat at toms pretty often  the bbq is awesome but so is everything else  dont sell yourself short just getting bbq  get the fish get the italian beef try their burgers and dont miss toms pride and joy  fair prices excellent food and friendly service,4
i ordered a couple of items from this place and nothing was really that good  the speed of the order and customer service was excellent but the food was average at best,1
brought my car in for an oil change because i had a coupon two weeks later i noticed oil stains in my garage where i park i brought it back to my regular mechanic and he said that the firestone mechanic that worked on it left the washer out when they put the oil tank plug back in and it was leaking,0
fyi they moved to a new building about 300 feet down the roaddont be fooled by the new building same old clowns working,0
i like  they have a good selection for us vegitarians however the consistancy in the sauces is not head on  they deliver on time and are very courteous,3
tall soy chai tasted like any other one that i have had at starbucks the bfs drip coffee did not taste like it had been there for a decade and they had a mug his mom wanted she collects starbucks mugs,2
perfect place for takeout  the dining area isnt the fanciest but the food is great,4
great prices and helpful staff free pool water tests and free advice to keep your pool crystal clear,4
after getting ripped off by leslies pool for pool supplies and repairs i now go miles out of my way to shop at b  b for all my pool needs  they are honest and reasonably priced all of their technicians are knowledgeable in pool maintenance and  repair,4
on the go  eat at rubiosnnwant fresh food in a clean environment and excellent service with smiles people on the go eat at rubios,4
i have been to totts many times and i have tried almost all the dishes on the menu kungpao and angel hair soup on the menu are amazing great for college students,4
one of my favorite places for lunch similar in style to places like pei wei but much better qualitynnmy favorite is the chicken pad thai,4
honestly the food is not bad at all and very short wait time and portions are large but i always get it to go since it always stinks in there which is very unpleasant they need to remodel seats are torn walls are dingy,1
what a store ive never actually been in a frys until the other day and they have everything books music video games washing machines tvs everything its like the walmart version of best buy,3
bad attitude  never thought i would not go to a mcdonalds  this one never go back always trying to up sell  please its fast food,0
best donuts in south phoenix it is the one thing that makes working over there totally worth it the maple bar is fantastic,2
great pizza pretty fast and good quality and freshnessnnthis place is affordable you have your usual big screens the breadsticks were fantastic,3
very good food all is from scratch and fresh pierogis are excellent serrol soup was new to me and was a pleasantly surprise in how great it tasted staff very friendly if you are not familiar with polish food they are more than happy to share how its made will be going back,3
im not a big yelper  but this place has gone so downhill is worth warning the masses  i use to have faith in this place but no longer   horrible job  long waits  go elsewhere,0
wasnt impressed at all for price i expect better quality chicago style pizza was burnt and wings where not even crispy,0
the windows and doors are boarded up apparently it is closednnthere is no way to get any food so i would skip this one,0
closed       nnsorry to see hims jl close  i liked the place,2
greg is so professional and knowledgable i have older windows and tried to get estimates from other companies but no other company knew how to properly install blinds with my complicated windows not only did greg know what to do he did it for a better price,4
pizza old roma is definitely the best pizza i have ever eaten great service always and very reasonable if you are out and just looking for a great pizza this is the place my husband is from jersey and loves this place says jersey aint got nothin on this place lol,4
love it here must try their hot  chunky salsa but you have to ask for it  tacos rock,3
the worst mexican ive ever hadndeserves no starsnbecause everything tasted like it came from a can enchilada saucebeanssalsanbecause everything was made with absolutely no effortnit smells of sewage and cigarettes insidendim lighting in restaurant and very dark parking lot,0
this place and other local spots like the teepee remind us of a far gone time when our mexican food was predictable and when our standards were low  but sometimes that hits the spot  this place definitely has some history just ask marty robbins,2
this is the closest grocery store to my house so its the one im at the most the cashiers are always super friendly and at least attempt to call me by my name when i check out which is different but nice very clean store its best to go later in the evening because wellits sun city,3
rescued my 1962 skylark convertible and took excellent car and concern for it rick the tow truck driver was great glad to find a quick courteous tow companysince i probably will be needed their services quite a bit with this beauty thanks guys,4
this arena is fun outside area reminds me of downtown disney with all the music people and food inside is clean but they need to lower the ac a little bit during the hockey game it was too cold even for my male family members,4
not a big fan but tax free yeah  off base has more selection and you can find deals unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere the lines get bad so dont be in a rush,2
love it that the staff is always friendly and knowledge  no pressure to hurry and not pressure to buy  nnonly if the games were organized a little bit then they will get the 5th star  can only standing there reading the slim covers sideways for a few mins anymore then that my neck is killing me,3
ordered the sicilian special  worst i ever ate  majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough  something tasted stale on the toppings  disgusting  this place was actually recommended lol what a joke,0
grease paradise you can smell the grease from two blocks away,1
horrible customer service i have to wait 40 min to return a charger that doesnt work,0
friendly service great food  and always very cleanthis is especially impressive since this dq sits right across the street from a high school and a block from an elementary school,4
whats to be said   its walmarts version of big box retail  i its huge clean and has friendly staff,2
this visit received a prompt greeting by the hotessmanager after efficient service food in a timely manner and as we ordered it restrooms were well kempt and as forrest gump saysthats all i got ta say about that,3
aaahhhh this place is the bomb chicken as it were nfound them through other reviews as a new place to try and their simply amazing one reviewer said everything was greesy and i would say thats true but in a very good way will have to go back and try the desert i was to full to try any this time,4
fantastic course  dont play slow or they will get on you but a beautiful course good pro shop,4
great food superb service wonderful menu  my go to place for an elegant date night  as yelp says yay im a fan,3
i love harolds i have never been able to go there at night because i have two small children so all i can comment on is the food quality i love it everything has been good from the pizza to the roast beef its a great place to go especially with a child in their terrible twos,3
why do i do this to myself we had visitors so we had to do harolds crappy food spotty servicenbut fun,1
been here many times and its always the same slow confused service i only go back because other cave creek bars arent much better now with oreganos opening i dont see myself coming back to harolds anytime soon,0
i love this place who eats a hot dog in fry bread   you will if you go to indian village   great tacos fry bread and burritos   stop at the circle k next door and get a sixy of your favorites to enjoy with the best mexican food in cave creek,4
food was good atmosphere is fun  if you like country music youll love this place,2
live bull riding night bbq galore indoor and outdoor bar view of rodeo action can be crowded at the front door an open barrel of salted peanuts in the shell you can even toss the peanut shells on the floor,3
this must have changed owners from the last time that we visited  you now have to pay for refills for sodas and there was a hair in my food  the waitress said that the manager was kind of mean so he wasnt going to discount our meal even though i couldnt eat it,1
really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good but dont order a side of beansnot very good and werent worth the money  wait staff was great and food came out quickly would definitely go back,3
terrible  we sat at the bar and never received service  bartender was rude and spoke only to the localsnnot worth free beer,0
this school has been an amazing part of my daughters development we thank roy kathy and the rest of the staff of ccm for all that you have done for us and alessandra i would hands down recommend this school to anyone,4
the flowers were beautiful  just as displayed on their website  and they were able to fulfill a same day request,4
awesome place to stop for a beer and a burger when out on the bike i great conversation and service give it a try you wont be disappointed,4
the buffalo blue cheeseburger is deliciousnnsmells good had to stopncant get enough of that blue cheese buffalo burger smells andntastes so good you got to try it,1
its a hit or miss here i had one good haircut but every time i went back i had a different person cut my hair and it was bad i went in a few days ago and asked for one inch off my split ends and she cut off about 4 inches my hair was wet so i didnt realize how short she cut it until i got home,1
clean great service great smiles and the cooks know when its time to take it off the grill eating breakfast starting my saturday with a great dennys start thank you,4

i have been going here when my tires end up wearing outthey will give you the best pricing i definitely dont feel i get taken advantage of here like other places will try to dothey have awesome customer servicei scheduled an appoinment online yesterday and today got in right away very convenient,4
nice place for homemade food large portions so you will not be hungry  and affordable for senior citizens too my mom likes this place cod  ribs  prime rib  breakfast are pretty taste,4
out of business,0
we have been going to vicki  precious paws since we moved here 4 years ago and have not had one negative experience  sure there are closer groomers but not one that we could trust the way we trust vicki with our little girlnnshe gets really booked up so plan your visits you wont be disappointed,4
jim and his staff are top notch honest and reliable if you dont take your car to them you are just stupid,4
love this place its like a neighborhood bar but all grown up you can enjoy a nice delicious meal the entertainment is always great make reservations gets crowded during the summer months service is outstanding,3
not much new to report here from my initial review way back in january  mike c  i dropped in for lunch today  its still a cafeteria not a buffet  its still allyoucaneat of a big variety of excellent american food for one low price  right now its 699 adult or sr including beveragennyum,3
great food and great pricesbeen a regular here for a few months  really nice its 24hrs since i work nights  and i always hit them up for the 5 for 5 mini tacos,3
friendly yes fast never billing is always messed up drugs are never ready when promised  so frustrating to deal with i would much rather deal with the other compounding pharmacy that doesnt make me waste so much of my time,0
i found nothing wrong nice staff food was fine no complients here  mananger was super cool,3
we went for breakfast on a busy saturday morning about 9 am food was delivered fast and hot omelette was big as the plate homemade jam for toast and the cinnamon role was divine service was excellent,4
absolutely horrendous service pizza that is basically worse than frozen pizza the waitress was 100 and we waited an hour and a half for them to forget our order ridiculous prices for the service and the terrible food,0
website pricing is cheaper than what you will get charged at this location attendant and cashier both agreed but just shrugged it off as for the actual wash they do good job,2
excellent family owned atmosphere,3
its not red lobster  and thats why i go there clean bathrooms  friendly waitresses  freakin hot guy waiters      tasty bbq  happy hour is amazing there not too keen on the live bands  but i still love it,4
would be a five star but the service was just bad waited over an hour for our meals  waitress was not too attentive  was served food without silver ware  so why a 4 star because the food was very very hood  the ribs were excellent   turkey nicely smoked  fries could have been more crisper,3
ordered 2 of the new loaded chicken bowls got the regular chicken bowls with out corn ordered 4 chicken littles no mayo they didnt put mayo on them but they forgot the pickles i guess thats what you get when you have kids working and dont care about customer service great job management,0
money money money give us moneynntheres not even a single cross at this place its more like a casino for adults the house always wins,0
stopped at this vintage aw restaurant on the way back from las vegas last weekend for a nice cool refreshing treat  we both had the classic rootbeer float  it was delicious and brough back such great memories as a child  only used the drivethrough so cannot comment on anything else,4
we spent our anniversary here  it was a good place to do so  very quiet and nice but not a lot happening,2
small quiet casino  check clean spaced out machines  check drink options followed by food  check low traffic  little smoke  checkity check,2
update im sick of coming here and having them tell me after a long wait in line that theyre out of whatever im looking for please after a few times i get the picture,1
buffet is good theater has shows all day for 6,3
angry dealers nasty tables not worth the gas even when you live around the corner,0
this place is pretty legit very deceiving from the outside but quality overall the reason i didnt rate a 5 star place is because when i bit into the delicious carne asada burrito there were a few tiny charred pieces mixed in there that i didnt like,3
wow amazing good deals prime rib dinner only 1000 and breakfast for only 200 this restaurant is a must have i love the neon raninbow filled carpet and lighting  you have to go here you wont be disappointed,4
been eating here for years service and prices cannot be beat i will continue eating here every chance i get until i leave vegas,4
i really like this place great selection of meats and latin products with quite a nice produce section as well i got a tad upset when one of the butchers didnt speak english but when the other one noticed he took over and was pretty helpful all in all a nice little market,3
12 for a tiny beef on weck sandwich and fries 11 for a pound of wings thats about 7 wings1825 for a large cheese and pepperoni pizza overpriced bar food to say the least,1
perfect for the locals to avoid the hectic crowd and pricing of other theaters at the casinos  no need to park at  a casino and pass through it to find the theater,4
ill be back  it smells like old vegas and i love it  friendly dealers plenty of old slots i hate the new ones and my friend got regular cocktail service even at a 15 cent slot machine  i think the only thing that slowed him was his liver recouperating from the previous casino,3
just good food very cheap the staff loves my son and we have been coming here since i moved to henderson in 1996 good local place to eat we love frank the drink guy,3
this mcdonalds has drastically improved since they put in the new drivethru system  i used to have to pull around front everyday and wait extra time for food or coffeenthe only real issue i have is that their specialty coffee is never consistent  it tastes different everytime,2
one of the best dive restaurants ever the portions are generous and the quality is consistentnthe corned beef hash is amazing and the service is efficient  friendly great value and worth the visit,3
food was average but waitress was terrible asked what was on cajun saladshe didnt know and didnt offer to ask she tantrumed when we asked for separate checks she rolled her eyes when my friend asked to add a salad,2
they have the best music band,4
came in super late for some munchies and to cure our sweet tooth i got the bread pudding and my friend got the french toast the food was solid but the service was less than desirable the bartender was more concerned with her phone and gossip than being personable to us,2
awesome place for pho  special combination is good  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad facen  but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area  service is excellent  hope nthis information is useful,3
sit at the bar jordan is awesome friendly and always positive   what an awesome bartender,3
youre greeted by the hot air and the sound of slot machines as soon as you step out of the airplane you know that youre in lost wages the shuttle system is quite good and the shops are nice too checked baggage also arrives promptly,3
id give it 3 starts if it werent for the fact that you can walk around with booze and you can play slots  other than that this place is not very special  i think im bitter because i took us airways  never will i ride them again,3
plenty to do at mccarran tons of shops and places to eat  there is even a 24 hour fitness slots everywhere wolfgang puck has a place to eat here as well,4
great airport easy to navigate good shops and decent food,2
airport with the nicest peoplenthey try to be funny and actually smile at you they dont yell at you to take off your shoes they just tell you instructionsnwith free wifi restaurants and slot machines like,3
its a nice airport and has many places to eat security seems to get you in  out quickly,2
its vegas baby how bad can it be,2
ehcould they make an airport any longer this place is packed and hard to maneuver through but its convenient location and only real option into vegas makes it good enough,2
this place reminds me of fear and loathing,1
try the pretzel dogs they are good,2
this place is dirty  they need to hire more people to clean the trash off the floor and the puke off the sidewalks nnso why not 1 or 2 stars well because there are slots while you wait a fair amount of places to eat free wifi and lots  of security lanes,2
nascar weekend 1 shuttle running from tsa to gates no very smart  almost missed my flight  also on a time change day  your killing me,0
the people that work here are rude sfo definitely way better,1
won 14 playing the penny slots oh yeeaaah,2
large airport its international after all but my god its a lot of walking needs more moving sidewalks ala bellagio  caesars  luxor  mgm style lol nncould also use a facelift its rather lackluster in appearance inside and out this is vegas right,2
its an airport you get to vegas and then you immediately go straight to partying even the airport is calling for a party with the slot machines located at the baggage claims nnthis airport moves pretty quick too they get the job done and fly you to your destination wohoo,2
easy airport to get in  out of  convenient stores  restrooms all along it would be nice if wifi was free,3
renovated and gorgeous plus arriving here is just the best feeling in the whole world just writing this review makes me ready to party,4
i imagine at least a solid 60 of people who are trying to catch morning or afternoon flights out of here are hung over nnwho thought it was a good idea to make this the loudest brightest airport in the country,2
old airport no wifi no charging stations,2
small quaint little airport pretty nice not the fanciest you can gamble if you like there luggage is weird you have to take a train to another area to get your luggage shuttle to the strip is easy and cheap 7 dollars one way better then driving and cheaper and more relaxing,3
this airport should be better,1
this place is all right check in was a breeze maybe because i came at 4am yes its old and outdated but theres free wifi so thats a plus for me,2
it was my first time in vegas the airport itself isnt as large as what i had expected it to be easy to walk and navigate through watching people still playing on the slot machines before boarding their flight was a hoot,2
in line to get my ces badge for the show the line went pretty fast,3
excellent servicecleanorganizednkt too many shopsbut usually one is done shopping as theytheyve vegas,3
ok this is the way to get to vegas and this is the tourist mecca  it was glitzy years ago but is now a bit divey and not so easy to get around  i am not sure how else you would get to vegas unless you want to brave the drive but the airport will not be the highlight of your trip,1
i really like this airport they have done a great job remodeling and upgrading it its nice and clean the tram system is very smooth easy to use lots of shops and bathrooms plenty of restaurants and bars to relax in they also have a few enclosed smoking areas if you have to smoke,4
youd think an airport is an airport is an airport  and youre mostly right mccarran is great because its so easy to get in and out of terminal 1 is kind of congested but terminal 3 is amazing always empty super fast security  airport food is airport food there the same overprice under serving bars,3
it was pretty cheap to fly to las vegas depending on how many days you book ahead you can save considerable monies southwest has easy checkins a long list of departure times and they leave from oaktown,2
flying on this airline is so much worse than driving anywhere that the flight is under 2 hours i think id rather rent a car and drive,1
its a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside from my short visit its apparent their main clientele are transient,0
if you are on a lowcarb diet you can order the saiman without noodles and with veggies instead i think i was charged around 4 they gave me bean sprouts and napa also still had the roast pork with it still a decent serving size and was pretty filling,3
good hearty asian style breakfast brunch lunch chicken good crispy and moist platters are huge saimin was excellent long lines but worth the wait mahi mahi was pretty fresh,4
this place is a gem for a local food lover the plate lunches are awesome and the won ton min is huge  the hotel its located in is a dive but this is worth visiting,3
pretty good place for local food at a reasonable price like the korean chicken plate,3
get like 20 spam masubis,4
this place is soooo ghetto the only reason i came here was because this cigar lounge was inside this casino which ended up being a bust as well this casino looks so dilapidated dirty and dingy,1
i came for the signature tamales and left wishing i would have gone to el sombrero  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor  it was also lukewarm  service was equally thoughtless,1
only stopped in for breakfast but really enjoyed it the restaurant has an old time feel and the waitresses wear the old style diner uniforms i remember as a kid the service was great and the food was good too im hoping to actually get a room here next time im on fremont street,3
i love this place i have been going here since before the moved it into the old church the owners are nothing but sweethearts and the food is delicious and totally inexpensive plus i just love the atmosphere,4
friendly and helpful staff clean and well kept spaces for the pets ive been a pet owner foster parent my entire life and this is one of the overall best shelters i have been too highly recommend finding the new addition to your family here,4
its a bit on the cheesy side and could use some major remodeling but my 2 year old enjoyed it enough,2
perfect for a local band and the cajun fries arent bad either if there is a neon reverb band playing there or another local bandyou can always count on a good dive bar experience,3
awesome place especially when tori is working she rocks,4
nice selection local hangout spot poorly located at least currently it requires a walk slightly out of the comfort zone for some worth it if you arent too cautious though,3
i will never use the greyhound again it was awful i was going from las vegas to ca the seats were uncomfortable the tvs didnt work the driver was rude and the employees werent helpful,0
i was unsatisfied with all aspects of their customer service process they did not explain things clearly their policies are not meant to help you and i had a very unpleasant experience save yourself the trouble and fly with rates so low i would give zero stars if the option existed,0
maybe the best pizza in vegas,2
by far the most greasiest pizza ive had in vegas total disappointment,0
good place to grab a quick lunch weather youre looking for a slice of pizza sandwich or pasta  be sure to check out their daily specials,2
part of the boyd line of hotels the fremont is good for gambling and not worrying about idiot tourists who split 10s or 6s against a face card but i digress i havent done so well here in a while but that just means that im using all the bad luck and youll have more good luck when you go,2
oml this food tastes like crapthe waitress is so damn slowthey should get someone fasterit is also in a really bad areathe food is disgustingdont recommend it,0
i went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the wellington  it now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way  just thought it was funny after my initial review  still very good though,3

quite the dive obviously a local place to gamble which is a great secret a tourist should not be privvy to the max bet on a slot i was playing was 60cents cmon ive played that slot b4 at other casinos and the max bet was 300 definitely a favorite place to gamble,3
ok  i have a new favorite downtown  really great place  makes all the others pale in comparison  cool slide into a shark tank in the middle of the place  and the breakfast was incredible  didnt really win any money gambling but had a great time,4
poor in room quality but close in atmosphere  the hotel seemed more personal not too extreme  staff is friendly  the gift shop sales liquor and i won 500 one night and 1600 the next on the same machine,3
i didnt stay at the hotel only went to the buffetnnall i can say is its bad when the best part of the buffet is the beverage,0
for downtown this was a great experience  free parking nice friendly staff were everywhere for whatever question you had   nice pool and water slide too,4
great hangout nice pool area,3
went back here for a few days was in g10 penthouse could not sleep tell 2 am  to loud outside music blasting bad room for sleeping,1
2 weeks after being promised a credit for 1 night still nothing  was on the phone over 45 minutes with no results,0
close to downtown if that is where you need to be  cheap room  terrible food from room service raw steak full of grizzle,0
we are frequent visitors to las vegas and stay exclusively at the gn rooms are clean staff friendly great restaurants on property and location is perfect,3
we came here to play black jack and had one great dealer who kept us entertained each time he was at our table very nice place and good music  the only reason i gave 4 stars is because it was a pain trying to order drinks while gambling the cocktail girls werent on top of it slow,3
smaller than expected and none of the cast members were there,2
just a regular old pawn shop i think i expected to see one of the cast members there which probably wouldve made it a 4 star experience still its something to do if youre in the area,2
yes its smaller than it looks on tv yes the guys are not around yes its expensive yes you dont have to wait in line if you go in the morning on a week day yes its fun to visit the place you see on tv yes you probably only visit once,2
dont know why they call this buffet world famous or award winning its just a regular buffet nothing special,1
we thought this buffet was at the california so upon arrival we followed the signs and ended up at main street station  its an ok buffet but nothing really stands out  the service was ok the food was average but the parking was free and the freemont experience was close,1
for the money best buffet that ive been to in las vegas there are better buffets but youll pay a lot more the food here was good and the area was also clean id recommend this place over the much pricier places,4
very good informative tour its all outside in the boneyard so bring a hat sunscreen and sunglasses also probably better to do a morning tour during the summer,3
very fun i would try to go at 6307ish because not all the signs work so its best to have dusk type lighting buy your tickets online ahead of time its only 20 people per tour,4
they dont carry bagel chips anymore and everything in there is easy found in hawaii  if youre from the mainland and looking for treats from hawaii id recommend asking a friend to send it to you,1
the buffet was ok for 11 but it was not worth the drive from the strip  definitely a spot for locals and not snobby tourists like me,1
good clean whitetrash fun i fit in quite well,2
horrible buffet tgifridays is good as usual with a great staff  the layout is great and there is no shortage on gambling options cant wait for the construction to be done,3
this is my favorite boa location staff is helpful and friendly it can get busy tho especially with all the retailers banking here ni dont mind it because after your done there is so many food places around that area,3
dont get the chi foot massage they advertise pressure points and reflex i spent 125 for someone to rub my feet it was terrible no skills they need to change their description and their customer service very unsatisfactory,0
this starbucks is alright their drinks are good but they arent as customizable as other starbucks i tried ordering things found on secret menus but they wont allow customization of any kind not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through and parking is very scarce,2
i like this starbucks locationnnthe workers are typically polite and efficient they are also yet to screw up one of my orders so i will continue to get my morning coffee here since the tropicana and decatur store is disgusting and slow nntwo thumbs up,3
this restaurant is terrible the taste of the foods are awful and they serve with lack of utensils and the worst is the drinks comes in a styro foam cup  i will never recommend this restaurant at all,0
tandy leather has all sorts of supplies and unique leather pieces for you to make your own bags belts anything leather they also have iron stencils for burning into leather such a find,4
its ok its a good price for what you get its about the same price is panda its definitely a hole in the wall,2
expensive and not that good the food is kind of bland being jamaican myself they could do so much better will not be going back unless its for something they dont cook i was not impressed at all,1
you know youre in for a bad meal when you hearn ding come from the kitchen this is the most flavorless jamaican food i have ever eaten i will not return booooo,0
good tablesnnweird brutish customersnnif you go in a group youll have a blast  but if youre looking to come here to practice pool by yourself i dont recommend it,2
the ladies room has a vending machine with sexual practical jokes in it for 075 which are not worth the price,2
been here a few times while in town  usually get the typical thai dishes when i come here w friends  the papya salad lad nah seafood half an order of duck and chinese broccoli  looking forward to trying other things on their menu but so farso yummy,3
definitly enjoy the padthai very delicious food,3
me and my friends call this our last stop before leaving vegas the orange chicken and mongolian beef is my absolute favorites best hangover food other than stake and eggs,4
the garlic chicken is awesome and the pad thai is about the best ever  we checked out the reviews and was do happy we did,4
always good and great lunch specials,4
dissapoint on pricing food didnt satisfy the spot2starfor friendly staff,1
stopped in to get a late night bit to eat its off the strip and was easy to get to had the chirizo plate and enjoyed it it was a good size portion of chirzo and eggs beans rice and 3 tortillas will stop by again and maybe ill try the carnitas,2
i have been coming here for 6 years and have always had an amazing experience  the bartenders are always friendly  and in the dinning room jen is an absolute amazing person to have serve you   also way cheaper for quality drinks right next to the strip,4
this place has it all the food courteous staff and ambience  the shepards pie and bread pudding are out of this world  be prepared for large portions  i enjoyed looking around at the interesting old photos and memorabilia on the walls  try it and it will become one of your favorites,4
im in vegas to renew my wedding vows and aloha happened to be near our hotel  they are amazing the employees are very friendly and professional they also had several repeat customers come in while i was there it was probably the best pedicure ive ever had,4
for a chain this flamingo ave ruths chris is in my top ten of all timesnopen till 3am awesome wine great steak and service i have been to four rcs and i think this is the best,4
i had the house special chow mein togo for 810nn a bit better than panda express pretty bland n small portion for the price few meat for their combon 810 for chow mein and their ayce dinner is1050 bad pricing n i have to come back to try ayce eating individual platters arent worth it,1
sucks wanted to do baby registry they tell me to do at kiosk after create password it said password not match asking for help nothing we can do at the store you have to call the hotline why im here for,0
been going here for over 20 years the owner is always very friendly and classy   my clothes always come out smelling fresh and the price aint shabby either definitely worth checking out,3
dim sum food came out cold service is poor no detail on check out billi will not come here at all,0
love this place good prices good service and the food is awesome now let us dancewith swords,3
one of the best if not the best in vegas i love the sunspot pizza the hot chicken fingers and nuclear fries are super yummo too plus they have awesome ranch dressing can you tell im from vegas the place is hella 80s and looks like the maxx from saved by the bell but dont be fooled this place rules,4
ive always done take out here  the pizza has always been consistently good,4
decent 80s style pizza but i prefer more of a kick to pizza sauce,2
loved the pizza garlic nots and salad the atmosphere could use a updo but service was good price fair great marinara and awesome thin crust pizza highly recommend,3
their 50 off for locals is a big rip off they add on 18 gratuity on the full price of the meal and to top it off their food is not very good its mediocre italian at best for their prices,0
this was a fantastic experience    eric schultz was a great host  the beef carpachio was excellent   the service was as good as the food   family owned and operated   we had a 6 course meal for two on our anniversary and the cost before tip was 140,4
went last night for a late dinner around 10pm the service and ambiance were great i loved the entertainment the food was pretty good except for my lamb i ordered it medium rare and it came out well done it was the worst lamb i ever had,2
they need so much help with their security system in the bowling alley  we had some things stolen  they also need to get that fridays out of there  baaaad service  baaad,1
buffet here is terrible on friday night seafood buffet crab was so dry it wouldnt come out of the shell and for 20 bucks per person the alliante friday night seafood buffet is much more worth it,0
fun safe day at the range customer service is outstanding we came in to shot on the range one of the staff members looked at our equipment and asked to check it out the next thing i know hes tuning us up thanks guys,4
great service every time just good old fashion dinner food large portions at good prices nothing more nothing less,4
was not impressed  server was rushed food was low budget  tasted like instant potatoes  waitress admitted the green beans were canned  peas in chicken pot pie were canned as well  have had much better experience at their st george location,0
this is one of my favorite places for breakfast the service is always friendly and attentive food comes out amazingly quick i highly recommend their bacon benedict and a stack of some of the best pancakes youll ever have,4
lots of imax theaters here great popcorn all the most current movies are always playing and its removed from the strip but only slightly so theres not an issue with crowds,4
seats are very comfortable,2
ive been charged twice with my account and they refused to give my money back i had to make a claim against them the place is not very bad but the staff are rude and as well as residence,0
this hotel is off the strip and i think all the fun of vegas is in the heart of the strips so if you are not there then it sucks its hard to get around like you have to pay for taxi and everything so i would recommend staying at another hotel in the strip,1
this place is a solid 3 for me  nnthe casino is oknthe buffeet is better than ok carnival buffetnthe spa is blah yeah it rhymesnthe rooms are oknthe beds are bad  nnbut for 200 for 3 nights holiday weekend there isnt much room to really complain  they treated me right,2
first time at rio  check in at 5 took 20 minutes  now at taxi everyone trying leave rio  this place suck  will never stay again  i stay cuz of friends  not worth my time or money stay away if u under 35,0
the rio is aging somewhat gracefully while its not the best its not the worst one thing i found odd there is nowhere at the rio that has a selection of craft draught beers,2
great authentic mexican food  found this place on yelp and it was great  home cooked food with homefamily feeling  would have never stopped at this place just by looking at the outside  well worth it,4
not the best place to dine at if you want to watch sports they have alot of tvs but there are better places to go also very smoky environment i got a headache from staying there too long i tried their all you can eat fish and chipsits mediocre i rather pay a little extra for better quality,1
this doctor was extremely rude and did not listen to my problems he spent more time explaining that he doesnt prescribe narcotics than he did explaining what might be wrong with me note i never even mentioned medicine to him other than what i already take,0
love this gym everyones so nice n helpful no weirdos stareing at you making you feel uncomfortable great equipment always go early in am for best workouts,4
just you average 24hours fitness gym you walk in and you forget what city your in cuz everyone looks the same  with the 1980s color scheme  i talk shit but i still go to 24 hour all the time  the 24 hour at silverado ranch is the nicest 24 hour in vegas  stay away from northeast locations,2
so i just cancelled my membership after 6 years or so no hassle there which was good got a refund for the remaining time nit is a nice place but i started taking yoga privately so no need for the gym for now,3
this place is open 24 hours and have an excellent fast foodpizza menu try out their philli cheese steak pizza chicken burger and chicken wings were decent too reasonably priced if i had to choose i will stick to pizza though,3
bad customer service cheaply made marble tabletops are dangerous and the manager will blame you for them breaking  i wont be back here again,0
such a waste of money i was very disappointed when i came here for my friends birthday dinner it is 2700 per person for food that is not that good i usually enjoy asian buffets but i was not thrilled with this one i will not be back,0
i typically use the drivethru and can expect to wait about 510 minutes before i get my burger combo and go the food has always been good and worth the wait,3
ok     so the three stars is for a mix of two things  the food deserves 5 however other than the bussers the service including management was awful and deserves 1nnhowever the food was amazing  all around so as long as you have a small group and no high expectations for service i would recommend,2
great view great service food could of been way better and price was way to steep i felt like i was paying for the view,1
the view at the top the palm hotel is amazing the service was impeccable but the food was average french fare artistically decorated  no one is my party of 4 was wowed by this restaurant,2
i asked for delivery ok they did it with no problems and quick enough 3040 mins ni chose just rolls nthe salmon one was pretty flat no taste californias were okishnnwhen i gave money to the woman who delivered she took them and left without saying a goodbye or thank younnmeh,1
excellent value exceptional quality absolutely the best ayce sushi in las vegas weve tried the others but nothing compares to s21,4
4 value slam gets 2 pancakes 2 bacon 2 eggs perfect balance good food a service keeps me away from cooking at home winning,3
after we were seated our waiter never came we had to ask another waiter after 20 mins to get our drinks we ordered our food and waited 45 mins the eggs were cold and hash browns not cooked dana was our server and she was just terrible worst dennys ever,0
terrible greens were burnt bad had 3 or 4 fairway greens never again will i go there,0
this is the first stop on diners drive ins and dives the stromboli is great ice cold beer and friendly staff the only thing is they only have 1 draft beer coors hey guys bud or miller would probably sell morenstill one of my faves enjoy,3
jus had chicken  dumplings at lous diner across from arizona charlies decatur so yummy jus like home in louisiana   behind walgreens so good good soup too homemade lunch  breakfast specials everyday feeling happy,4
scott said everything that needs to be said except that yes i can find clothes in my size the mens department is always neat and orderly in fact the whole store is like that unlike the other place i recently commented on and prices are at least not outrageous,3
i only go here to buy carne asada  its not as salty as cardenas meat  fast in and out  buy some green onions for the grill too,4
best selection cuts and quality of meats in the city the ny strip and delmonaco are outrageous now thats what a steak is supposed to taste like,4
a mais completa de acessu00f3rios de moto que ju00e1 conheci,4
got ripped off on an in store pick up that i ordered online received one action figure instead of a three pack beware when ordering from toysruscom and picking up at this location,0
they ship their bread in from philly its real deal amoroso rolls oh yeah its 24 hrs too thats always a bonus nnits not a restaurant so expect to takeout or eat at a small picnic table outdoors theres no indoor seating minus one star for thatnnits an authentic cheese steak you wont be dissapointed,3
i think this place owns the hot dog place which makes sense  no one seemed to really like the pizza and everyone was shooting here for a 2 hot dog  too bad the hot dog wieners are slim like slim jims  just okay but great if you are short on time and funds,2
we got a room for 35night a motel6 price for a betterthanmotel6 room with muchbetterthanmotel6 amenities  the pools are awesome  you get a free drink pass  gym is pretty nice too  i approve,2
ghetto no wifi and room service stops at 2pm seriously disappointed jacuzzi didnt work right furniture was falling apart very sad hotel,0
i dont know why everyone bashes the excalibur i recently stayed here and it was great everything was clean nice flat screen tv walk in shower got upgraded for free too nnthe pool was off the hook,3
if youre looking for a nice clean place to pass out from partying all night then this is the place for you not a glitzy hotel but i personally would rather pay less for a room so i could have more money to do other stuff the pool was nice and cleanperfect for 100 degree weather,2
a great value for your money if you get the rennovated rooms in tower 2nhowever the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing my advice is to get your room here and expect to party elsewhere,1
dont get fooled by the low rates excessive charge on the internet uncomfortable and torn beds,0
small casino area but i did have better luck with the 5 min roulette table beats the hell out of aria 15 min bet the buffet was good for its price wish they had more food options free luggage storage great for an early check out an late flight out,2
this is the cheapest place to stay on the strip i dont consider circus circus or stratusphere the strip it is alot of fun staying here,2
this hotel is very kid friendly with the fun dungeon and jousting shownthe arcade games are a bit pricy and the show is expensive the room are ok they are very small and the beds arent that comfortable this hotel is definitely just a place to sleep not to hang out it,1
fun casino with lots to do for the whole family the arcade is one of the largest ive seen on the strip with tons of affordable games and tournament of kings is an awesome show,3
gets the job done large rooms good location  on the other hand it is run down a bit dirty and smells funny,2
nice facility dealing with the behind the scenes of exhibiting can be challenging but what do you expect,2
large facility was part of the tradeshow for info comm fits a lot of people and easy transportation,2
ive been to the tussauds in london in hollywood and love the one in vegas although they have many of the same figures in all three thats the economy of scale you get having multiple locations i guess  fun to take pics of you and the celebrities and get right up and see them up close and personal,3
dans cet amas de junk food vous cherchez de la cuisine saine  vaguement europu00e9enne nngo there,4
terrible service  way overrated osso bucco gave 10 bucks off from my complaint and argued with me that it was one of the house favorites  taste like crap on my opinion,0
theres a good selection of frozen drink options here  the 190 octane was average but the bellini was disgusting  it was super sweet and tasted waaaay too artificial  the prices are very affordable and its worth trying  next time ill get something else,2
i have only tried the bagels and bagel sandwiches here and i go back weekly  enough said,3
way overpriced ironically in a bad neighborhood the price range is incorrect its not under 10 under 10 you can get some tiny side but thats it,0
i thought the food was pretty good i have done alot of really good tapas and this was just pretty good these guys pack it in like sardines and a young good looking crowd it is too busy for me on the weekends i would go back but there are many other fish in the sea so it wont be soon,2
great place to eat tapas without having to deal wtraffic parking reservations tourists on the strip  we liked the followingnnsangria red wine pitchernbacon wrapped stuffed dates wonderful pecan surprise insidenshrimp diablo sauce is the real winner in this onenham and cheese croquetas comfort food,4
the best calamari i have ever tasted in my life the sangria is also amazing it is a very nice environment but if you dont get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat,4
skyler the bartender was outstanding should be nominated bartender of the year great drinks and service,4
great fun  great food usually crowded so get there early our group tried 4 different entries and they were all good,3
service was great we had to wait for our table but they quickly took an order from us at the bar for appetizers and drinks the menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent great atmosphere,4
i just found out that harrahs is the largest hotelcasino operator in the world  i am completely amazed  i have been to several of the harrahs locations and never ever thought they would be the biggest  based on the level of service they are just oknnspend your dollars elsewhere,1
first time staying at harrahs and the rooms were decent only problem we had was the noise factor we were on the 15th floor and could hear the live band out front all night long in our room it was very hard to sleep casino and dealers were great,1
casino review  place is run down  slow to get drinks  i like their lake tahoe hotelcasino location better  luckily place was too expensive to stay,1
in line for check in at harrahs with people lined up going out the door and only one person working at check in amazing seriously one elderly lady all by herself,0
the hotel itself if finennthe internet is horrible most pages wont load if they do it takes 34 minutes,1
i booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the lv strip thats why i chose there it wasnt that bad but if it wasnt on the strip i would look for somewhere else,2
ugh a wolfgang puck chinese restaurant need i say more i hate pf changs and any restaurants resembling it nntake a good look at the clientele and youll get an idea what sort of food youre about to eatnnexpensive and not good why would anyone even consider eating here,0
spent 2 nites right  the bar at my favorite vegas joint  spago is what makes vegas special  great appetizers  wonderful drink concoctions by 2 spirir pros tony  peter  we had a blast here each nitennwell be backlike we always do,4
food was ok but service was awesome our original group of 10 ballooned to a group of 20 and they didnt blink an eye and accommodated our groups last minute changes,3
see my other yelp under forum shopsnnbut damn  i love this store and the forum shops  wonderful experiences,4
the food was ok ordered couple of appetizers dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great but i was not impressed at all place was nice and clean server was niceni dont think i would ever come back here but i can atlest say i tried it,2
great mexican fare absolutely tasty and well executed great for lunch not sure i would have dinner there in the canal shoppes mall unless you really want to see and hear the gondoliers on and on a bit pricey for classic mexican food no matter how good so rating is set  at 3,2
this is a decent mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment we had some wonderful beef enchiladas and a nice dining exerience,3
this is a great way to avoid the 100 degree temps the shops are high end but bargains can be had if you look around the restaurants are of good quality with none any better or worse than the other,2
the food is made to order and tastes great  its a small place and based on the food alone is probably busy all the time,3
everything is good tacos enchiladas and mole,4
it was goodwe were all hungry after hanging at the pool all day so we wanted a quick bite to eatnnthe nachos came out fast but the rest took a little whilenni had the chicken tenders salad which made me wonder why didnt i just order the chicken tenders hannat least the boys had a good view of the tv,2
this is the main store but its also in a few strip clubs around town including my club rhino good selection of clothes shoes and jewelry sadly i wish some of the people were friendlier and they had more of a selection if clothes i dont know maybe thats just me,2
3 stars for the revolving carousel bar  nnbazookos circus is what the whole hep world would be doing saturday nights if the nazis had won the war this was the sixth reich,2
worst hotel in vegasnnsuck ass,0
it has a great area for kids plus free circus act shows if you arent traveling with kids then i cannot recommend this casino it smelled and no one came around with drinks the whole time we were playing craps and blackjack the place is in serious need of cleaning and renovation,1
circus circus has not changed much since 1995 except that the buffet is 1595 now instead of 495 back then  the decor is stuck in the 1980s and the rooms are unfortunately worse with wildly circusthemed decors  much better choices,1
its certainly a start and is convenient for getting around to some places but it really ought to go all the way to the airport  also considering the short distance of travel 5 is quite a lot,2
worst way to get around the stripfirst the machine was out of order to buy ticketsadditional machine on 2 floorgot there a security offer told us to back againnwhen  we finally got the monorail was not even easy to get out to the strip they make you go throw every casinosw,0
there was a salesgirl named jen here and she was great she was this little bubbly thing and helped me get into my size four birthday dressthanks,4
the casino and hotel are dive city  the area is sketchy and the hotel seems to lack security  the casino itself is tiny and smells like an ashtray  i kept it at 2 because the slots are loose and the bar was friendly  will i go back i dont think so,1
this place is terrible so bad we lied to get out of staying a second night light and air dont work its liken a renovated motel 6 so shitty,1
went beyond my expectations foodambiance and service was awesome i highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and the grilled chicken with cilantro cremation we will definitely be back,4
not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks jerk chicken dry coconut shrimp was ok sauce was nasty and the dip for the chips were nasty will i return hell noneverything left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses,0
this is good old school italian for 32 we got soup delicious minestrone or salad garlic bread very good veal parmigiana a full liter of house wine and a delicious cappuccino for dessert it was worth the cost,2
sucked it used to be soooo good years ago the prices are way too high for what you get and on top of that they charge you 10 extra per person if you share a meal food was not great tasting either i used to recommend it but not any more,0
awesome oldschool style  good food usually busy but the wait isnt generally long great staff and you can expect to pay from about 30 to 5000  person depending on what you want the salad bread table wine  a cappuccino to top things off are included in the main course price worth the walk,3
if you dont have a reservation dont show up they tell ya 45 mins and it turns into 2 hours not worth the wait when hunger,0
food was terrible completely flavorless sauce was watery the free wine is not drinkable,0
yummygood portions lovely atmosphere,4
a standard godiva store but who doesnt love delicious chocolate these tantalizing treats will give you the pick me up that you undoubtedly need after day drinking and hopping,3
a great place to pick up your snack and beverage essentials for your room  dont forget to pick up bottles of waters so you can stay hydrated after a day of drinking,4
cool store nngot my souvenirs thereand probably saved a few bucks compared to getting them in the airportnnthey had other things there personal itemsalkie etc if you forgot something this is the place to buy it,4
i would never giver a star on this location very unprofessional people works at the printing they should be fired in my vocabulary im front the east coast and i mean business i was there 112414 at 945 am calling store manager,0
clean inside with pretty decor  never busy with great service  nnthe tableside guacamole is devine  yummmmnthe margarita cheesecake is a straight up hangover curenthe cancun sauce is unique and deliciosonnnot the best mexican food ive ever had but it has a small soft spot in my heart,2
babsj,2
when the cook rhythmically chopped an onion and said choo choo as he pushed it across the grill i felt deeply embarrassed nnwho is this guy and why is he being so cheesy is he insulting my intelligence does he know that there arent any children at the table  nneh whatever the food was pretty good,2
this place was terrible my wife and i stayed here years ago rip only good thing about this place is my wife and i staying here when we first met thats it its was cheap compared to the rest of the hotels on the strip the out side was typical with a average decor,1
very helpful every time i visit,4
we each got a salad and it was fine  nothing too exciting but left quite satisfied  the rolls were delicious and there were a few varieties so that was fun i might eat here again if im in the shops area but wont be rushing back,2
i  like this place good price good value taste is good and service is goodnpretty romantic too,3
had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues food was very good service very good great location  even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the courtyard outside the restaurants entrynndefinitely would go again,3
place is nice food is good ordered the roasted half chicken it was superb  it had a crunchy skin and was well spiced bartender was a good wine selector service was well oriented 4 stars due to a higher price,3
last night we came to canaletto for my 30th birthday all i have to say is delicious food was amazing service was great and the view of st marks square was nice too all around great experience we will definitely be back,3
the employees spend toonmuch time with there backs to the customers talking amongst themselves instead of focusing on providing better service,2
awesome property bur the first night our room smelled like onions  ketchup tonight it smells like fish sticks we want to move but nothing is happening lame,2
this place sucks be careful when making reservations you have to tell them you want the grill  40 bucks for dragon rollcome on 25 bucks for four pieces of sushi should have went to mandalay bay or luxor for some fine seafood,0
the food was good but i would like more for the price i paid service was not that great,2
these people are scam artists they quoted me 3 times the amount as everyone else and gave me a 4 week turn around i took my car next store to metropolitan auto body and paint and they did it in two weeks and helped me with other damage with no extra charge,0
big crooks liars people jim is the  biggest  thief he charge for parts that not need to be fix or replacement watch out people from this place,0
this hotel is amazing  love it  the only downside its expensive if youre price conscious  besides the room plan on spending 15 per drink at the pool bar etc  if pleasure ranks above money when booking your next vegas trip stay here,4
heavenlynni was there last weekend and once again it was amazing wynn by is one of my favorite place to stay at in vegas bellagio is the other the staff is amazing the hotel is amazing the service is amazing the food is amazing and the gambling is great nnthank you,4
such a beautiful hotel  the fact that theyre connected to encore makes it super easy for you to get your clubbin on the view of their golf course is absolutely amazing a huge patch of green in the middle of the dessert,3
ripp off  they charged for a soup and egg white 4500 at the casino  that is insane their staff is rude and impuliteni will never but never ever go there again,0
reasonable place located about a mile away from the strip  rooms are not bad either  wish the waiter service was better,2
was here for breakfast the other day food was good and the service was excellent and quicknnfood 4nservice 5nnoverall 45 rounds down,3
pretty average would equate it to a chilis or red robin service was 5 stars and the local music they had going was 5 stars too drinks were a little steep food was good just not very unique,2
the food may be cheap but you do have to put up with some atrocious customer disservice from the maitre d to the waiter everyone made it clear you are a bother and should just go away you have to be pretty thickskinned to put up with such nonsense for a big plate of meat,0
the first thing that hits you is the smoke as a nonsmoker it sucks but as a previoussmoker i can deal nnthe only reason why i go to ellis island is for the free pizza and the free slot play for having the players cardnnthe root beer is the best ever though,1
terrible service food wasnt even decent prices were average i think the only type of ethnic food was the mexican food and pretty cool that they have their own name beer was alrightnnni wish i knew this place sucked so badly before even thinking of coming here,0
i couldnt even detect the hops in what they assured me was the ipa the rare sirloin was the rarest rose the breakfast burrito was good service was quite friendly smoky atmosphere of course,1
contacted by a marketing person from ellis island for more info about the incident i respondedthen never heard another word really think they do not care about customer service clearly enough people show up for the cheap food whateverjust sad,0
holy smoke this place had so much cigarrette smoke in the air it looked hazy  it made the dining less enjoyable  we went for the famous steak special and i must say it was pretty darn good  the green beans and mash potatoes that accompanied it was enjoyable as well,2
ok i get that you want to keep this place og and all butthis place is durrrty and freaken stinksnbut 3 stars for the bombcom steak and eggs and prime rib special  nnext time ill try the bbq,2
no idea how this place gets such high ratings service is terrible slow uninformative no follow up not good  food was average,1
this place is  too great to be describe when you want good food and cheap price i had all my breakfasts there when i was visiting la because that was the first thing that came into my mind when i woke up,4
mehnpork chop with eggs was dry bread had a very salty butter buddies steak was good dont care to go back,1
gets the job done had a weiss and a light beer  got me buzzed and i think ive had enough unpasteurized beer is good for you in moderation,3
we use to come with all our friends for their steak special but we were really disappointed the last few times we came  never mind the service is slow the food was not worth the wait,1
not a good service experience after the third time they give preference to people who arrive after you and i would not reccomend going there terrible experience from the owner,0
gandhi is awesome please dont take my word for it go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and i bet you youll fall in love with it this comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish,4
shady dirty dark and stinky on the plus side they do have cheap tables but despite all that you come here for  that 1 monster of a hot dog five stars for inspiring margaritadrunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy,4
what kind of mystery meat do they put in these wrinkly giant hot dogs actually i dont want to know but it filled me up for 2nnand you blackjack people who constantly double down when the dealer is showing 10 and you have 10im going to choke you,3
no more 99 cent beer no more diarrhea inducing 99 cent shrimp cocktail no more 14 lb hot dogsdangitwhats a cheapskate to donwell at least the snack nook has footlongs for 199,1
i dragged my party down to slotsafun because it was the last place that i knew on the strip that had coin operated machines  i miss that chingchingching sound and a bucket full of nickels unfortunately its gone from here too,1
this place used to be my favorite on the strip we used to go for cheap drinks and footlong 199 hotdogs and now its been replaced by nathans unimpressive dogs  they swapped out a lot of slots for arcade games which is decent but im just generally disappointed in the changes,1
sure you get what you pay for  it is probably the best value in vegas  if fanciness is not high on your priorities  it feels like a family place  casino is fine  buffet is a little lame but we always go to the peppermill anyway,3
never going back got to our room broken pieces of hard candy on the carpet and on the shower nob hot cheeto on the side of the night stand,0
you get what you pay for and the riviera is no exception  the casino is definitely dated but doesnt feel as dingy as it could  the rooms are comfortable and the pool is decent  worth leaving the property to find good food  the walk to the strip is fairly quick too,1
good hotel if you just want a place to stay when you are in vegas its location on the end of the strip is convenient if you are into walking a bit if not  take a bus it stops right in front of the hotel nyou can get cheap and ok drinks at the hotel bar  the room was clean,1
worst vegas experience i have ever had the entire casino went down and would not let me cash out hundreds of angry gamblers last week had to wait two and a half hours to be manually paid out on my machine ordered a rollaway bedtook another 2 hours never again,0
being generous considering we found two bugs the beds are comfy  staff is a little pushy on hotel promotions not the cleanest but not the dirtiest,1
the girl sarah at the makeup forever counter is fantastic she knew what she was talking about and made my night i looked fabulous i am so coming back for every event love it,4
not a phillies or eagles bar as they claim to be asked the bartenderowner how the phillies were doing and can you get them on tv her response wasi dont care about that that means she doesnt care about my business keep your ghetto cliente and keep watching your cooking shows,0
naw i went to this club at 1031pm on a saturday night and there were no strippers on the dance floor i asked the bartender when they would come out and she was like i think they could be getting dressed all of them,0
it was a great hotel its not luxury but it was very quiet and clean the staff was nice and very helpful i would stay here again you are around the corner from the strip so its perfect and a mile from the convention center its super cheap too cant beat it,4
came here for a quick lunchlocated inside the planet hollywood mallnit has a hawaiian theme to it allnserver was nice just took forever for our food to come outnfood was okjust super slow service,2
way cheaper than walmart and way cleaner this is a great store i went in late and didnt have the coupon but the clerk gave me the deal on cereal anyway which made me really happy thus im writting this review never waste money at walmart again,4
best pizza ive had so far in my 29 years of existence lol it has moved over to mgm grand for those that dont know,4
i thought i would really like this place but i just dont find anything really special nnthe burgers and fries are just soso pretty pricey for a burger joint even for vegas standardsnngood that its open 24 hours,1
i was really impressed with their boca burger  its not every fast food hamburger joint that has a veggieburger  i was really glad it was well done because i ordered everything on the burger  it seemed like this place was always open people were constantly lined up to try the fatburger,2
beware they use lean meatnhaha just sayin the burger was kinda dry but definately a pretty good burger and fries got 2 burgers and shared a thing of fries total bill 30 not bad wouldnt go back though,2
i really enjoyed the burger joint the sandwich was great and to be honest leaves you wanting more i enjoyed my experience,3
worst experiencenwe sat and ate here the service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible im not a fan of mcdonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this 7 something piece of tasteless foodnnever going back,0
3 words bigass souvenir shop,2
4 levels of m and m cuteness a fun place to check out im a sucker for those yellow m and m bags you see people carrying around the strip i found a cute calculator with m and m for buttons years ago sadly i didnt see it here this time around and resisted getting something just for the bag,4
a good tourist spotnnjust outside is a whole bunch of impersonators such as jack sparrow michael jackson mario  luigi marilyn monroe spongebob etcnninside is a whole bunch of mm souveniersnstuff is expensive but something fun to see on the stripnthey have free 3d movies to watch only 10 minutes long,2
its a cool place to visit  somethings are cool but i found a lot of things to be overpriced,2
same old mm world with colorful hard shell candies everywhere the only thing that ive found new is the 3d ride they have on the 3rd floor is that new i dont remember it being there before its a good 510 minutes longnngreat for kids and the sweet tooths,2
nice to look at but its much more crowded and everythings more expensive than the nyc location,1
another store in the sea of souvenir and tourist trap stores on the strip this place does have cute souvenirs though they seem overpriced tshirts and towels for 20 each is a little steep given the free advertising i would be doing for you,2
dollar corn dogs on tuesdaysscorennlocated conveniently in the fashion show mall nnfunnel cake sticks are amazing and only  275,3
partying all night in vegas would not be complete without a night at drais hot hot crowd coool people easy to get in not easy to leave,4
staff was very courteous we were there for a private super bowl party it was all catered and very nice although the game sucked,4
spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine if you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke then this place is for you,0
not bad  great location  1 margaritas small but yummy outback steakhouse  dennys is connected to the hotel  its a decent place to stay if you just need a place to crash for the night,2
didnt stay at the hotel but the craps game is the best even though it only pays double on 12 it offers 100x odds well worth it for cheap gaming on the strip the place is a little old but not run down with low ceilings and the air smelling like smoke the locals are friendly and the drinks are okay,2
yum  although you dont have a menu to choose from the fixed meal is awesome  the steak melts in your mouth and the shrimp scampi and bread is awesome  its a good place to take friends todefinitely not your typical restaurant  i highly recommend it,3
yummmmmmmm  eeeeeeeee  taste eeeeeeee,3
i love this restaurant ive been eating here for years when it was still at barbary and not only is the food great but service is like none other  get the dover sole if you like fish and lamb if you like meat  delicious onion soup and salads are made tableside  its pricey but well well worth it,4
place was not good food taste bland and it is way over priced for what you get orange chicken was nasty and so was the fried rice wont be coming back here,0
after making this place my first stop in vegas every year for 10 years this will be my last service and good was way off tonight i could get better at a panda express,0
ordered the pepper tofu and was expecting it to be a nice pepper sauce all we got was tofu in pepper with no salt  could not eat it with rice had to ask for sauces and fix it on the table thanks but i can eat at home if i need to cook my own food,1
this place is flatout awful  long line to get in the bar and had to pay  lame  music was whack with a bunch of ugly fat chicks dancing on stage  the offer free shots but theyre just pouring bottomshelf liquor into your mouth  when i ordered my drink the snobby bartender told me i needed to tip her,0
had the most amazing dinner with my wife on her birthdaynthe sirloin was the best ive ever had and i recommend the cheesecake for a after dinner desert,4
best steak in vegas,3
amazing prime rib was so tender the green beans are a must the only downside was the price 125 for the surf n turf,3
my ny strip was very tough thought my knife was dull but it was not would not come back,0
terrible service and terrible drinks will never go back total waste of 200 ugh,0
it was in our hotel so it was easy to get to  but this place lacked in anything original  it was just fine  nnchips and salsafinenenchiladasfinenmargaritamehnnso it was affordable it was close to home but it was not fantastic and not someplace i would seek out specifically in vegas,2
surprise i loved this place great chips good drinks music dancing the works the food was great the staff superb wish i found it earlier,3
loved the happy hour  their bartender frank is super friendly and made us feel very comfortable  taquito appetizers were fresh and very delicious  we came back every day of our stay,3
terrible service the guy was very mean im glad i am just a tourist but dont go here there are other great kosher places around town jerusalem grill has a friendlier staff,0
this place used to be the place but the owner has tripled his prices i will be finding another repair place,1
quick and easy money exchange at great rates funny thing is the ladies behind the counter have not traveled much but they are making their kids travel study abroad live abroad and so on,3
great transaction ladies are wonderful and gives you awesome advices  validated my parking stub too tip we found place easily by reading other comments on here rates are awesome and worth the trip,4
we walked in for happy hour took a look around smelled like a funeral homennwalked outnnmaybe this place is good if you are retired,1
the caribe cafe is in the mirage hotelcasino in las vegas and is your standard coffee shop no more no less  standard fare reasonably good servicenni sat at the counter as a single recently but i wouldnt advise it  there is less service there and they kind of forget about you,2
my chicken parm was okay but my mom ordered the salmon and that was amazing my aunts was also ok and why it only got 2 stars i would expect for consistency especially with how prices all the food is having to track down your waiter is another reason for its low score,1
conveniently located at the entrance of the mirage its a great location for grabbing a quick beer   my only issue is the two fat tire beers cost 15 bucksyikes,2
good lord the chinese food here is totally dumbed down american style because it tastes nothing like chinese i swear their kon pao chicken pass off as dog the only thing i dug was the atmosphere for its supposed to be tip top classy,1
from the apps to the desserts i have not had a bad meal yes you can find one in most major areas but its good food why not hit the places you know are dishing out consistent meals,3
good food restaurant was way too hot,2
chris the shuttle driver is awesome he made my day and is a reason id stay with super 8,4
food was very good  had an oyster sampler plate with various types  salmon was cooked to perfection  overall a fine choice,2
avoid at all costs horrible service and horrible food,0
total loss the bread was like wonder bread the pasta was good but the sauce lacked any flavor and the price for the portion was minuscule you shouldnt go away hungry from a 23 dollar italian entree,1
amazing steakhouse every time i come here im not disappointed great customer service prices are lower  compared to the places in the strip the quality of the steak or seafood are high not that many peoplenknow of this place hidden jewel of las vegas i would highly recommend,3
i love this pretzel placennthe pretzels are big sweet and usually soft i also love their lemonade it is seriously deliciousnnthe service could use some work im not a big fan of the fuchi face but other than that this place is great,3
one of the best meals we ever had  cant rave about it enough the vip martini was awesome rochelle was our waitress and she was great must try this restaurant if you are in vegas not cheap though so bring a full wallet,4
this place was amazing great service perfect timing of all courses the 12 ounce filet was easily some of the highest quality meat ive ever come across while being perfectly cooked and the lemon cake made fresh in house everyday was the perfect end will return soon with a smile on my face,4
we love this place when we come to las vegas  highly recommended for the steaks,4
a must every time i go to las vegas  get the lemon cake,4
ill make it quick   awesome steaks  rib eye is my favorite  great sides and awesome service  great steakhouse just barely off the strip  its a steakhouse so its not cheap so be ready to spend some   every time i go to vegas i try and visit this place,4
if you like mediocre food slow service like really really slow and indifferent food servers then this is the place for you  oh did i mention they are also way overpriced,0
great stop waiting for a concert to start friendly staff good drinks,2
i ordered the crispy salmon dish on a blended pea sauce  the blended pea sauce was actually refreshing  the salmon on the other hand was nothing to rave about,2
horrible experience service is slow and food is not properly cooked i order fetuccini pasta with steak and they overcooked the meat and brought it cold this restaurant does not provide fine dining i do not recommend this restsurant to anyone,0
listen if you know anything about donuts this is the best in town not no commercially made crap made fresh everyday by the same person if thats not dedication i dont know what is they sell out everyday then they close that in my opinion means something also like i said best donuts in town hands down,4
i stayed there for 4 nights and was very comfy there is a cute little kitchen and they leave you a basket with cheesecrackersand fruit beds were very comfy will come back,3
every indian in las vegas eats here if youre not indian and you want to eat where the indians eat this is it its the bomb and i dont mean baynneveryplace else is like the toilet that kid hid in in the movie slumdog compared to this,3
awesome indian food and service,4
very good hotel food tasted really nice they have a 50 gift card for 40 that you may possibly use immediately if you bought this before seating also they may give you 15 of if you are group of 5 or more,4
wow huge i dont even think ive seen every corner of this place nnseveral stagesnnupstairs roomsnngirls are super nice but maybe cuz im a girl actually no its cuz theyre strippersnnstrippers are nice and they smell nice,3
had a bad experience you couldnt get a place to sit unless you spent 700 plus on bottle service had half the club roped of and empty fyi it was 45 a person to get in we stayed 15 minutes it was that much of a downer,0
lobster was too salty  my steak was over cooked mentioned it to the waiter who offered to send it back but also told me it was cooked to the right temp but last i knew medium rare isnt fully cooked around the edges with a small rare center not all the way through,1
slight mishap with being given salmon when swordfish was ordered but quickly fixed very pleasant server everything was fresh food delivered timely and at a non rushed pace overall another very good experience,3
had breakfast at the suede ordered the buttermilk pancake and it came with sliced bananas and a small container of shelled nuts it was ok but i didnt think it was worth the 1200 they only provided 2 tiny containers of syrup but a large pat of butter coffee was 400 yeaha bit pricey,1
great atmosphere food was comparable to chillis or applebees very entertaining,2
come here if you want to spend 50 per head on burnt bitter steaks soggy vegetables and weak sour drinks,0
nightmare the reservation line and hosts are not on the same page we waited for an hour in line anyway for overpriced average at best food and elephants that were heard but not scene and under construction,0
not very good the atmosphere was ok the food was ok we had a lot of kids with us and they were not that impressed also there are better choices in vegas,1
the food is really nothing special the great thing about this restaurant is the ambience this fish tanks are gorgeous and awesome nnfood  nothing to brag about still a nice time though,2
a bit much for adults but great for the young ones  lots of animated animals and large fish tanks  food is amusement park fare to match the ambiance  a bit pricey if you dont appreciate the showmanship of the place  fine for families but not for a date in my view  service was very slow,1
definitely not coming back ever though the sushi was good but you can find much better places around town for cheaper their servers are pretty bad and not attentive enough,1
all i have to say  hot waiternoh and the pizza was awesome toon,3
cpk in vegas is the same in la the servers were very attentive and we never had an empty water glass d enjoy,2
i love this place i usually go to the one in beverly hills but this one is just as good we had an amazing server that is a las vegas natiev she was very attentive and by the book the food was amazing i love their wine selection cant beat that horseradish it is the freshest ive had,4
loved the prime rib great potatoes and salad and wine waiter was friendly atmosphere was really good will go back hungrier next time,4
we went here to have dinner first night in vegas and after waiting and watching them sit four different partys that came after us without we left just rude,0
rooms are nothing special ngym is smallnfree drinks and breakfast is only reason to stay here,2
much better gambling return than on the strip,2
this is the place to stay if you dont mind being just off the strip and are looking for a great place it has it all,3
very impressed with this hotel first time here and i must say this place is incredible,4
nice ok yes expensive but when the food is really good and the service top notch its on my list of favs nowhad foie gras and au gratin potatoes and choc souffle au gratin a little boring everything elseyum yum,3
why go any where else food is the best on the strip best executedwine list rocks with interesting choices and the view is well the best in vegas,4
great view the best creamy french onion soup i have ever had love the staff love the menu try the lamb burger it is to die for,4
great view but the food is average and the service is ok  if you can just go for a drink and eat somewhere else,2
the rack of lamb was great  also the view from where we were sitting was breathtaking the bellagio fountains the bellagio sign just everythingit was my anniversary and im so happy that we went to this place  the staff were attentive to every need,4
great food incredible view excellent service what more could you ask for weve done the prix fix many times and just ordering off the regular menu is great too cant go wrong for a special occasion dinner here,3
great view food and service my gf and i went here to celebrate my return home from deployment wonderful experience,4
had 900 pm reservationfinally was seated at 1030 pm food was mediocre at best dinner for 2 50000 not worth the money the view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant,0
must to avoid confusing system indifferent service sloooooow bland food,0
great starbucks coffee  enjoyed the worship team    pastor kept my attentions with his style  enjoyed the message   reminds me of other mega church styles including elevation in charlotte central in vegas and saddleback church in southern ca,3
food was good waiter wasnt personable or friendly asked if i wanted a refill when i still had food on my plate one glass minimum i guess on dr peppers,2
my children love coming  for dinner here always great food and tasty desserts i love their coconut shrimp  ymmy,3
great selection of flicks but management refuses to hire enough staff to man ticket window got here 15 minutes before start and couldnt buy tix in time line for tix machine ultra long too no respect for customers,1
theres only one reason i come to chilis and its their to die for  southwestern eggrolls  delish,2
i get the chinese donuts i dont know why they are so mind blowing but they are just amazing i recommend trying them if you have a sweet tooth,4
maybe the employees shouldnt use the main entrance as their smoking area was disgusting having to walk through the 2nd hand smoke of 5 employees right outside the main entrance nkosher deli is nice,0
reopening this friday,3
not nyc style pizza more like the pizza i had to suffer with in buffalo ny thick crust garlic knots with hardly any garlic cannoli not good either dont go there looking for ny style pizza,0
this cafe was so good the raw pizzas and burgers were excellent  they also have a large selection of fresh juices and shakes the cookies and cream shake was my favorite  i strongly recommend this place for any raw food enthusiast in the vegas area,4
not impressed the clothing was geared toward women in their 50s or 60s like the matching outfits and printed pants the prices even after the discount was not much lower than department stores like dillards i tried going back but i didnt find anything,0
probably the most terrible customer support i have ever encountered after being berated by the office manager over the substance of my call i was then told in other words to go to hell i will never receive services here,0
never had a bad meal here love their singapore noodles plus service is great,4
this ihop was ok the food was alright has small quantities and very expensive on breakfast items even though its dinner time the staff was alright but slow,2
i just called from califto buy an anniversary gift for family in summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long  this is not good customer service  hope theyre better in person  im taking business elsewhere,0
never again nn1 bland food everything taste canned or packaged nn2 expensive for the low quality nn3 service is bad nn4 miserable decor nndont waste your money nnworst mexican restaurant meal i have had in my lifetime guaranteed nni suggest super mex see my review durango215,0
if you are looking for a young israel keep looking this kiruv centric  aish shul is great for a weekend or two but dont move to this side of the city if you are modern o or more observant youll get frustrated fast,0
great food great service mondays all you can eat crab legs for 25 and they have really great bbq,4
this is one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas it has amazing food for the price nni am also weary writing this review because i dont want that many people to know about it,4
the laziest service employees you will ever encounter they will thwart you right from the start give you all the kinds of excuses not related to your cars complaint and problem just to reject the job,0
this was a great experience to be had there were 4 of us that went and we had a fun time playing with our delicious courses i have to say of you have not tried it here you are missing out the dessert portion was delightful and the steaks and fish were great we will revisit this place again,4
every vegas locals favorite sandwich shop you cant go wrong with anything on the menu but the most popular sandwich is the bobbie its thanksgiving on a sub roll and they do it perfectly at capriottis,4
i have not met dr miller  i go there now because dr canfiled retired from his practice and sold it to dr miller  the dental hygienist was the same and she does a fine job,2
adam is a great teacher he keeps the kids engaged in the class and laughing my daughters skill level goes up every class she lives to go and looks forward to it all week,4
i was charged 130 for a 60 tire 20 for 10 tire tape and 20 to put the tire on the rim outrageous,0
mediocre  too much quantity over quality and whats with the huge beverage glasses waitress didnt know much about the food have to say tho had a better experience at their location near las vegas airport,1
this is the best mediterranean restaurant ive been to the koobideh was fantastic,4
the curry is bland and so was the hummus,1
great service love the gyro and athens fries,3
had high expectation so wanted to like this place was quite disappointed so so service ok ambience food was bad a good test is how well the lamb kebab is prepared i had to send it back and get something else as it was super chewy like rubber disappointing,1
great food and fun classy atmosphere i love the menu because there is something for everyone everything ive tried has been good but my favorite is rice pudding with turkish coffee and the hookah lounge is a great place to hang out with friends after dinner,4
horrific experience i was probed and prodded without even a smile  can you at least offer to buy me a drink never mind i wouldnt even take a drink from these heartless people that work here they treat you like cattle meat stamp poke next,0
they dont do ayce  but prices are reasonable otherwisesince we pretty much only do all you can eat we wont be back picked up a few rolls to go and quality was okay not the best,2
the tilapia filet as well as the babaganoush and the loubieh are amazing fantastic service with great fresh food make this worth the drive off the strip,4
i love coming here because of the staff the food isnt amazing i seem to always have a problem with mine however the owners have told me they are switching things up and to check them out again i like sitting out on the patio they have tvs out there which is nice ian always hooks up the best drinks,2
came to watch hockey and have a couple drinksno sound and was told they dont turn it up it disturbs the gamers why bother having the tvs wont be back,0
i just went in here looking for a leash for my dog and was so disgusted by how sad and sick the dogs they had looked i had to walk out  something needs to be done about this place  all of those dogs should be rescued and they need to lose their license,0
i have had their brisket on several occasions pretty good stuff i am a bbq fanatic if i like it you may love it i have tried bbq from some of the best cooks in the world that being said this stuff is pretty damn good try it for yourself,3
drinks come in a large jar baked beans are sweet and delicious we split a full rack of baby back ribs my side was tough but my husbands was soft the ribs have a dry rub with some sauce on top the coleslaw is vinegar based not mayonnaise based it tasted okay the potato salad is okay too,2
i always have great service here but they messed up my order and did not have it available at expectation date,1
very nice people and great food got warm chips and a salsa barthats my type of baralso dessert bars are nice as well nnback to this place cheap fast and friendlypretty damn good these days,4
i emailed them my review to give them a chance to reprive themselves annnnnndddd nothing,0
very lame portions at this location its almost as if they have a game going on how little they can put into bowl very disappointed totally killed my experience at this entire chain,0
the smoothies are great i ask for no sugar because they put a quarter cup in sandwiches are taste but they microwave the chicken sometimes they are under staffed and you have to wait a while so give yourself time,2
this is the worst location i have tried nothing tastes the same as the other locations the staff are like drones not enthusiastic or happy at all  i love tropical smoothies but will drive farther just to not go to this location,0
this course is as advertised great fairways great greens and views are awesome  my only gripe is there is no grass range for the price they charge there should at least be a full sized range not a small one,3
everything is just ok even if your hungry service is suspect the daytime bartender heidi wont change the channel on both of the tvs in front of me because one customer requested both tvs first im glad he didnt request all the tvs in the place come on heidi think for your self,1
salsa was ok tomatillo was excellent rice and beans were bland steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much get over the water charge folks it is what tis waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didnt like that knife had crusty food on it they replaced it but still gross,1
we had a party of 8 for a bachelor party friday night what a great time we all had the service was extremely attentive and fun the food was very good and everyone loved their margaritas nnwould totally recommend this place,3
awesome not your typical mexican restaurant their brunch is out of this world gourmet steak and eggs gourmet oysters rockefeller gourmet green fried tomatillos gourmet bananas foster crapes at eat myself sick,4
came here while hanging at the pool for a change from the greasy pool food they serve it was pretty good not too pricey and chips and salsa were pretty decent,2
amazing mexican restaurant amazing food amazing service amazing drink just wow so glad i discovered this gem there dips are great i had the enchilladas and there mojitos are great to beat the vegas heatnwill definately go back next time i am in vegas,4
this happy hour is like a two hour trip to hawaii at a 6 price point for island infused cocktails mahimahi tacos and bbq pulled pork arrive on an empty stomach i have dreams about their pineapple martinis their sushi rolls are reason enough to veer off of the strip,4
yuck  worst all you can eat sushi experience ever  i recommend that you take your money and go elsewhere,0
the best sushi in vegas hands down my girlfriend and i love this place,4
all you ca eat sushigood price in las vegas missing one star cause service should be more improved i ordered a cup of water it never came until i called the waiter 3 times,3
been to yama twice and both times were awesome my husband and i ordered the all you can eat sushi the sushi were quite delicious and they also had a variety will definitely recommendnnmy only complaint is that the price for the childrens all you can eat was the same as the adults,3
my experience at yama sushi was okay ive had much better sushi at sushi mon nayce it seemed like we were bothering the server by just ordering i would have been upset if we had paid over 23 we ordered 9 rolls and i can honestly say i only liked 2 out of the 9 needless to say we wont be returning,1
terrible service there was a reason why i didnt tip the server and before i left she stopped me and asked me why i didnt pay tip seriouslynnokay food nntry blue fin instead,1
been going here for years all you can eat at the top of line sushi and are the chefs here fast the service is great,4
so dirty super greasy menu dirty plates food was bad bad interior very bad overall experience im just being honest,1
typical diner food not bad not good egg and i is a much better breakfast place i had classic eggs benedict and hash browns nothing really blew our socks off husband had turkey and dressing little on the dry side gravy was bland,1
awesome mediterranean food athens fries are yummm and the rice pudding definitely a musthave the chicken kabobs were also pretty good the helpings are pretty large though btw love the ambience too,3
great ambiance went strictly for the hooka and the booze comfortable lounge and eclectic music waiters and waitresses were very friendly and knowledgeable great for small groups,4
no stars would be more like it management is bad bad bad nwe will never return ni dont care how good the food is bad people,0
make your way over to paymons once and youll be hooked stiff drinks and tasty mediterranean dishes await you make youre u get the ice base on your hookah it burns all night long ndont forget tuesdays are local nights and select appeitzers are half off,4
i love paymons during the summer they have the best cold cucumber soup so delicious the chicken curry hummus dolmas lentil soup are all satisfying i think i am going to go there tomorrow for happy hour yay,4
great food the food is really good but the hookahs suck we had to call the waiter over 15 times to fix our hookah and it was very unenjoyable maybe i would eat here in the future but i will never smoke here again,1
what a crappy place surrounded by crappy people to have to get a health card closed for lunch as we arrived are you kidding me what a racket for unnecessary government fees,0
the phone department is very knowledgeable the geek squad department  is slow and doesnt have great  customer service they give  you unrealistic time frames and have you  wait an extra 30 minutes while they chit chat between each other in the back,2
horrible service horrible food dont waste your time or money,0

food was good but nothing out of the ordinary  a little greasy  would not make a point of coming back,2
wolfgang struck out on this one  7 member squad and nobody liked it  very bland very boring  were all from nj  ny so maybe thats why  wouldnt spend another dollar there again,0

some of the best chicken fingers in las vegas if not anywhere they are huge made in house and you get a ton easily shareable this is no joke go now and get an order it wont cost you but like 8 and will be glad you did they have other food too and it is all well above average for a bar,4
filthy store terrible selection only two checkout lines open  absolutely the worst grocery ive ever walked into  the store needs to be demolished and rebuilt  with new employees  better selection and prices at a drugstore or a convenience store,0
the work they do is great their prices are affordable but this place is never open when they say they are,0
i have been with sprint for 10 plus yearsi have never had a 4g phone with fast service i use to pay for it each month they have been saying the same shit for 5 years the towers are not up yet dont buy it,0

worst service evernthis office doesnt answer phone calls they were supposed to pick us up from the hotel and never showed up this office should be closed,0
quick  delicious lunch with a great salad bar,4
quick lunch spot with a plethora of options in varying degrees of healthiness  we were there with a group of 7 and everyone gave their varying sandwiches thumbsup which is a good enough endorsement for menni had the french dip and the chicken panini split with a friend and both really hit the spot,3

a 5 for the dosa lassis and the service  on a separate occasion we took inlaws from india for the lunch buffet they said it was the best theyve had in a long time  i would love to see them offer a chinese dosa or genie dosa,4
bad customer service here and people are super slownni asked the waiter to add one more item to our order and he said he doesnt know who our table helper is and simply left  without letting us know whether he added or notnnsecondly it took an hour to get the ordernnoverall super bad experience,0

great food and great service the chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious,3

i dont like waiting my appointment was at 6  and i waited 30 min when she did come out she was in conversation with another client and made me wait longer i ended up leaving and she didnt even apologize dont know where all the good reviews are coming from,0
we went on the friday night underwear night egads there was this guy in his undies bending over the bar i thought i saw a sign on his back that said insert here but it was pretty dark in therennsuper friendly and no attitudes a great place to hang out for a while,2
appears to be out of business no web site phone disconnected and nobody there,0
you have got to be kidding me old stylists even older clients nothing new or innovative i guess this is where old stylists go to die,0
if i could give them a zero i would i walked in and asked for a new set that curved in more towards my finger tips and she told me that she didnt have those kinds of tips every other plave ive gone to just forms the acrylic like that lazy lady was more interested in her phone such crap,0

the place smells wonderful  the selection runs to mostly white flour breads and a few sweet items  the bagels are decentnot water bagels but there doesnt seem to be anywhere in vegas that makes real bagels,3
its a pool supply store   i usually dont go to these places but i was trying to get a solar blanket for my pooli had all the blue prints but still not enough info  really   dammmm it i have to go back again,3
you cant go wrong with a salad from wendys  i also love their value meal chicken sandwiches  i really like their pick 2 menuallows for a healthy salad and a little treat like fries or a shake on the side   when i want to grab something quickwendys is always at the top of my list of considerations,2
first timer here and i cant believe i actually paid 20 for a one day pass not even a free trial gym was super packed and machines were a good wait other than that theyve got every machine this gym is okay,2
dirty all over the food area ni dont know if even have health  card nneed in nevada to work with food ntaco stands are cleaner than that place,0
the lady was so nice the food is a bit americanized but still very delicious the spicy noodle on korean menu was especially good,3
the noodles before the meal was good ordered from the korean section got a bowl of noodles floating in fishy soupy cornstarch no taste but smelled fishy bbq ribs were soft but seemed like bottled sauce was poured over the top right before serving very disappointed,1
ive been here twice in the past month around 7ish the drive thru takes at least 10 minutes horrible drive thru,0
good location but please do something about all the day laborers standing outside they line up the street,2
messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said i was lying okay yah i lied about what i ordered horrible customer service and the orange chicken i supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting,0
always always always goodgood prices and large portions i usually have it delivered but the few times i have been in to the restaurant it is clean and the staff is friendly as a matter of fact i am ordering my regular right nowmmmmmm,4
went twice in the last two days we ate at the bar the first time around 4p chicken wings were amazing fries good too came again for breakfast on sunday around 1030a service was horrible but food was good,3

love my gym working out,3
worst mexican food ever the coffee was disgusting it tasted like water i have to admit that the guacamole was good though  but other then that i do not recommend this place at all the price you pay is not worth the food they serve you id rather pay 5 more to eat at a buffet,1
was here today the food the service was great left feeling full and complete a lot of bang for your buck,4
typical jack in the box  clean  staff is friendly  drive thru open 24 hours  they have the selfserve kiosk which means you can get free tacos from time to timennpersonal favorites includenegg nog shake during the holiday seasonntacosnultimate cheeseburger,3
everything you need for crafts but be prepared for a 30 minute wait to check out,2
waited for five minutes for someone to acknowledge me go to target on blue diamond much more helpful,0
i have been taking my two babies here for years best docs best staff wouldnt trust anyone else,4
got a groupon for the ultimate wash for 5 i liked that they scrubbed the car before it went in  thoroughly dried it after i will go back again,3
by first look this place is amazing but when you really start checking things out you see how expensive it is they do have some cool things but the place is so jam packed its impossible to see everything i went in looking for a tv table  never was asked if i needed help or anything,1
best all you can eat around,4
the best ayce sushi in town service food ambience everything you wont find another ayce sushi as good as this,4
i go here because its closennyellowtail collar is strong fish is fresh only thing i dont like is that the rice falls apart too easily that is kind of a big thing when it comes to sushinnwould i go here again sure but i definitely would drive farther to go to a better place,2
if you are having a party and need some inexpensive decorations then the 99 cents store is the place to be packs of two streamers 99 cents package of 20 balloons 99 cents plates utensils napkins you guessed it 99 cents the kicker they have plenty of colors to go with almost any color scheme,3
great drink prices and nice staff in the bar but sooooo smoky that i could only stay for one drink,2
best nail salon in vegas affordable and great quality i go to le and shes so sweet and does an amazing job my gel manicure lasts for three weeks and i just go change it because i get bored with the color no chipping or peeling like other places best price in town,4
awsome,4
awful does not begin to describe this clip joint  awful service and the food was about on par with a dennys  somehow this place has managed to stay in business ill never be back again  if you want good italian in vegas skip this place,0
i had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and i have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations the complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant italian familys recipe,4
i told myself a few years ago i wouldnt go back i gave you one more shot never again nmeatball sandwich had two two meatballs cut in half to make a sandwich cheap fucks all for 80,0
this is the pizza place we have been looking for great service great food they have a full menu of options small dining area makes me feel like im back in my hometown,4
i get my pedis here love the staff unfortunately i had the joy of sitting next to a whiner  complained about everything for the love if god you are getting a 20 dollar pedi  because they are fast efficient and super friendly i will keep coming back,4
not bad for if youre looking for some quick take out nothing good or bad to say just your standard strip mall take out place,2
aok in my book nike sbs are getting harder to find at least in nike outlet stores but this factory store had one so i just had to get it my current sb is dilapidated so i needed a new one,2
brought my truck in for squeaking brakes tech craig came an got me pads are still 95 he said these will last long time  no service needed  mary at the desk is super friendly  fast an honest service  just made a new customer thumbs up,4
these people have no idea what to sell you they just point to the startup boxes when i could have saved money buying better items separately no knowledge on reptile health also sold me a turtle with one eye really,0
this place is terrible the waiters are on their cell phones most of the time management allows other patrons to scream yell and cuss at the television as well as other patrons all while banging on tables and the bar,0
good lord this was probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed in  all that was missing was a crackpipe and a police body outline on the ground  i was even afraid to take off my socks in my own room   but you get what you pay for and i did pay a ridiculously low price to stay here,0
i come here pretty much everyday but that doesnt mean i like it i only buy gas from here if im completely on empty otherwise i go to the chevron up the road but i am a slurpee addict and i need ice so i continue to come here,2
the staff here makes the place great every time i come here the employees are prompt polite and really friendly nnand the kfc bowl is heaven in a dish,4
this mcdonalds is so close to my place that its become a task to try not to stop by here on my way home  so far i have not encountered any problems with either the staff or the food here and the service is still quick  thats about all i can ask for in a mcdonalds  keep up the good work,3
it seems like every time visit this location they never seems to have what i need also some plants dont look so healthy i go to the other location which is far sigh,1
nice people but way too loud for a neighborhood bar,2
the midori margaritas are amazing we had the carne asada tacos they were cooked to perfection,4
every time i shop here for pool repair parts i get the wrong part the chemicals chlorine muriatic acid etc are not good quality and the place is operated by amatuerskids,0
decent cheap haircut always a 2030 minute wait  ive called and been told no waitinghung up the phoneand travelled the 30 seconds to get thereonly to find 7 people waiting for haircuts  mark is a good guy if hes working  good haircut and really fast just what im looking for,2
just had some of their tres leches cake last nightvery good,3
i guess im not eating here today apparently its a cash only day   feel like they could post a sign on the door or tell you as part of the greeting,0
this target is a great target it is always stock and clean the employees are always nice and it is fun to walk around for a little while when it starts to get hot totally am in love with target,4
possibly the best selection of products when it comes to a best buy  unfortunately nothing can make up for employees who say one thing and do another,0
great staff and they never mess my hair up perfect everytime they so send out great coupons for an awesome cheap cut,4
at this taco bell it takes two people to mop the floor one to mop and the other to watch she must be training in general i avoid this one because the kids that work here spend more time socializing with each other than paying attention to the job they are getting paid for,1
dishonest thieves stay away,0
scam  they put synthetic oil in my car when it doesnt need it confirmed with the dealer and charged me over 70 for the oil changennavoid this place for their unethical business practices,0
since ups took over mailboxes etc that leaves postnet for fedex  i had a manufacturer return package with tag ready to go and just dashed in dropped it off greeted by friendly staff and dashed out  simple and easy,2
they ran out of chicken  had to wait 20 minutes nuff said nnmichael was the manager btw i vote for him being the worst manager of all time do i have a second nn this location should be named kentucky forgot chicken,0
people are helpfully but poised off that the financing lady just her deck and left me there for more there 20 minutes,1
i ask to see deep couches ornate wood dark fabrics im shown blue couches and i literally just walked away from the sales associate huge selection of lame styles,2
used to be better beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it walnut shrimp over cooked chicken tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken yuck,1
the worst company ever  didnt even show up  booked on tuesday for a saturday cleaning and waited around for hours but nothing  when i tried to call the office the number was disconnected  so disappointing  so unprofessional,0
you all have to be kidding me i am in town for business went by all of your reviews and when i walked in it was nothing but disappointment  a very very small collection of books in the entire store geesh  they need some stock so many empty shelves,0
i love the new york style pizza here if you havent tried it youve got to one of my favorite pizza spots ive grown up eating im not a huge ranchon my pizza pie but my buddies swear by their secrete recepe here the buffalo chicken strips taste so great and just being here brings back memories,3
very slow service  been here 30 minutes and my car still hasnt come thru the wash part yet  no one seems to know why things are taking so long,0
i would go backnnreminds me of a mom n pop stop  people were friendly service was pretty good  the food wasnt anything to write home about but i did enjoy my meal  i liked the casual setting and its in a convenient complex with plenty of parking,2
worht seeking out for sureneggs benedicts if really goodnservice is fast and friendynmake the drive from the stip you wont be sorry,3
great food and service place is small but comfortable as soon as we sat down we had someone come to us for drinks i will definitely go back to try some of the other menu choices,3
coffee and pot of bread greatservice is bad breakfast took 2 hours  food was just ok had to ask for to go box twice and then it was thrown on table our bus person jose was the nicest person there probably wont go back,0
we are here and loving it  great food and friendly service  the top breakfsst restaurant on my list,4
the food here is so generic and whatever but i had a few gift cards to blow up and i did then my rectum blew up after i ate the food in the words of wayne campbellnot so zhang again i am baffled by resteraunts that spend tons on decor and pay less attention to the quality of their food,2
easy to make appointments on line or calling in no long waits for an appointment  appointments begin on time  dr steed and staff  knowledgeable with great customer service  contacts and glasses come in within days of order,4
great customer service  always get you in and out as quickly as possible   employees are on top of issues and polite,4
im usually pretty happy except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business today i did a late night shopping and was disappointed i had to check myself and bag all my groceries  the machine likes to give you a major hard time looking up vegetables was a pain call button is ignored,1
never had a problem with this dq great blizzards food took a little while but thats common when you order the chicken strips service is always prompt and pleasant,3
dawn is the best,4
this place is a cockroach haven  if you love having cockroaches in your bathroom garage front yard kitchen and even at the pool live here this place should be condemned,0
it was ok the pineapple chicken fried rice was so gross the food wasnt hot and not the most flavorful i wouldnt suggest this place,1
i wont speak for the whole company but i will tell this branch is undertrained very unfriendly and makes no apologies for it,0
one word racist,0
service sucks they are always messing up orders and are rude to customers one of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration so rude and unprofessional,0
will never go back i have see 2 roaches near the sushi bar and one crawling near my plate great staff needs to fix the bug problem,0
adding another 5 stars they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other ayce sushi placesnnawesomennminor gripe the hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor oh well its all you can eat,3
only place in vegas that has ayce sashimi the restaurant itself looks outdated and old but i honestly just care for the sashimi oysters and soft shell crab service can be improved upon but overall good,3
patience is required as they take their sweet time and it isnt even busy its been 30 minutes and i dont know that theyll be done soon i would come back because its cheap but definitely not during rush hour,2
worst service ive ever had in my life horrible and unprofessional dont bother here,0
oh heck no dont go herennthee most painful pedicure i ever gotnnthey cut deep into the sides of your nails and after the guy with blond tips was done with my manipedi he washed the tools with soap and cold water thats so fricken dirtynnmy feet still hurt,0
very poor customer service,0
super slow service mediocre to poor foodid check out other ihops in the areanot worth your time,0
pretty darn good chicken sandwich french fries were above average chicken wrap for take out was soso but ill definitely be back since its so darn convenient,3
mediocre pizza,1
always friendly  easy access on and off the highway which is great for the work commute,3
so its a neighborhood place  nothing more nothing less  the service all depends on how busy they are  if they are slow you can expect good service if they are busy not so much  but  i love their chicken wings and fries any time i have a craving for chicken wings i end up here,2
regarding their custom framing  i cant believe it took them 2 full weeks to finish framing my picture  either they have alot of work or they work slowly,0
i hate the pharmacy its always slow at this one,2
competition for nv energy is coming in 2015 for information contact me  i cant wait to switch deregulation of energy,0
smaller amusement parknoverpriced foodnlong linesndidnt have a fast pass systemnalways crowdednparking was awfulngood rides were closednntypical amusement park,2
way too expensive for the type of food they serve even the domestic micros are at least a dollar more expensive per pint than just about anywhere else in pittsburgh do yourself a favor and take your dollars elsewhere where they will go much farther,1
silver cloudsamazing nnsmall intimate museumbut amazingnnshows held in lobbyamazingnna sure stop if youre in pittsburgh,4
great museum  loved it  i usually spend a short time in museums but the warhol museum had my attention for houes  beautifully done and i love that visitors can touch and interact with many of the exhibits,3
terrible service  rude staff  horrible waitress  dont waste your time or money  plenty of better restaurants to select will never go back,0
really really great service  diverse menu  apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime  nice atmosphere,3
nice selection of items good pricing and friendly atmosphere well be back,3
i find the decor very odd and the menu limited the infamous burger i was supposed to order i forget the variety disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked the oftmentioned fries were also underwhelming,2
this is a fun staple in pittsburgh where the locals and university students alike come to dine 10 bottles of wine is an attraction as is the fried fish sandwiches they have delicious fish sandwiches,3
good food and big portions i usually get their burger which is very filling it has a nice casual atmosphere,3
pork chops curry soup are tasty nnlo mai gai is good but has no lap cheungnndofu pi juan is vegetarian,2
price is reasonable service is good food average i eat at alot of thai restaurants but this pud thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesnt resemble the flavor or texture of authentic pud thai otherwise everything else is average,1
i like this place they have good food i go there a lot since its so close to my job their service could be better but overall is a good experience,2
not great but good,2
my favorite place in madison to see a band good sound not too big and friendly staff,4
good but not the real deal  the big 3 pizza deep dish places in chicago i feel are better,2
its the best pizza ive ever eaten yes its a bit pricey long waits blah blah blah dont care i love you,4
place makes legit deep dish pizza no one does it better in champaign only place to go for piazza like this down south lunch special legs you get their piazza slice for like three bucks great deal for a hungry college kid,3
clearly im not the only one who learned about thai from the y  now that ive had a lot more thai food i still fondly recall the pad thai from the y  great food wonderful prices and always fresh  it was so good so close to home and so worth the wait in line,3
great martinis and cocktails in generalnthe bartenders are also super sweet so be nice to them,4
i liked the pizzanbut not enough for the wait timesnni mean reallynnid rather just go to peter piper order a pizza and play some skeeball instead,3
best pizza ive had anywhere  perfect perfect and i mean perfect crust  thin chewy smoky and sweet  lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh local produce  i deeply envy the regulars here,4
so looks like someone at that craphole called biancos cant handle criticism and is send private messages further proof place is bogus,0
pizzeria butanannwhere they treat their customers like dogs,0
il forno  much much better,1
great guy  and great pizza  good experience all around,4
overrated  while the food here is good its not worth the long wait,2
pizza was not a great as we had expected and service was well below  pomo in scottsdale is better and closer  probably wont go back nnthe staff were not friendly and it wasnt even that busy  we went last night  to much success has gone to there heads,1
this is a good pizza place but not up to all the hype if you want a great pie then take a trip to la and visit monzza  monzza makes the best pizza in all the land,2
service 55 friendly and accommodatingnnfood 55 outstanding outstanding outstanding pizza,4
i guess i dont understand the hype the service was very good but the pizza was completely flavorless the sauce was the strongest point but the cheese and sausage were completely bland the service earned them a third star but i wont be going back,2
i feel that this place is very overrated  the wait is ridiculous if you try going for dinner and i think the food is soso  i would prefer to go to cibo over pizzeria bianco,1
best pizza in america  it was good but definitely not the best  worth trying if there is no wait,3
a wonderful experience  truly great food served by outstanding waitstaff  really worth saving up for,4
great service and food  awsome place to bring outoftown friends  martinis and bar staff are professional and knowledgeable  best martinis in town,4
food is 45 no complaints great menunnservice can be a little slow little rowdy environment at times crowded etc dark small bathroom nndeserts are best ive seen or had at a steak house,2
there are plenty of restaurants with great food or even better food for a fraction of the price its just ok my shrimp on my salad were so overly salted that they cut my tongue scallops were great steak good too just not worth the absurd prices,1
this place is amazing  one of my two favorite spots in az so far  nnthe lobster quesadilla is awesome  not your typical quessadilla but way way better  the flank steak torta was very good too  i cant wait to go back and try everything else,4
great food great service great atmostphere what more can you ask equally good for a romantic dinner or a business meal,3
great food who cares what it looks like outside fish tacos were amazing check this place out if you want authentic mexican,4
basically my favorite creative mexican food spot hands down best guacamole in town get it with everything in it  including the pomegranate seeds the low rider margarita is awesome also their signature pork dish is pretty tasty,4
not even worth it 130 for a family of 4 this is the pf chiangs or worse of mexican food 5 horchata and 10 churros comedor dela guadalajara is still the bomb,0
awesome  great food great vibe great serviceni highly recommend happy hour for 150 mini tacos  they were all great especially the shrimp and halibut,4
the best guacamole everything fresh we were a party of 4 and all my french guest enjoyed their meal perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served thank you,4
great guacamole pricey but very fresh with a different texture and unique mix of ingredients  fish tacos fresh and not heavily battered pork tacos were also very good side salad also very good  friendly service,3
if arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in phoenix then i must say they are out of their mind this is by far the worst mexican food i have ever had staff seems to be very arrogant simply put if you want authentic mexican food this is the last place i would go to,0
from the music to the coffee to the furniture this place gets it or at least gets it for me i havent had a bad coffee there yet the brownies are super rediculous good the music is loud and not on the radio,4
this place is one of the best coffeebars in phoenix but if you cant get your flipn internet to work any better ill continue to look,1
my wife goes here ever chance she get but i refuse to go with her coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude i refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular joes like my self rudely,1
everything here is tasty  they can be crowded so expect that  wish they were open later when my friends want to go boozing and i want an espresso,4
incredible food whether you just grab a freshmade scone or order a full meal good coffee it can get crowded but it is a fun and eclectic atmosphere i definitely try to bring outoftown visitors to lux to get a good feel for urban phoenix culture,4
aaaaahhhhhhhh i walked into this place happy and instantly turned into hipster emo girl what is going on the music is really sad and there are a lot of flies around get me outta here the coffee and treats are always good though,2
this has got to be the best most amazing little  coffee place ive ever experienced  besides cafe trieste in san francisco wish we had this in boston,4
lux feels trendier than id prefer but their macncheese is to die for  go get some  you wont regret it,4
this location is a glorified garage sale it smells and nobody speaks english children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people nnif you are lucky you can find shoes but i have never found jack shit for clothesnngo upstairs to marshalls and spare yourself,1
dont shop here  sych,0
to sum it up i sat down where president bush sat the food was as awful as his tenure as president loved the ambiance though,1
amazing food went there for my first time and food was fresh nnim a huge fan of mexican food  have had a lot but this place is awesome the service is great  fast but the seating is not quite roomy although it didnt stop me from enjoying my food,4
excellent mexican food clean and decent prices for the amount of food  will definitely be returning,3
yummy mexican food but the atmosphere feels like a chain still worth it for the chips and salsa this one is really close to scottsdale fashion square mall,3
this is one of the worst places really i cant believe that they expect people to pay for this stuf they serve as food we ordered fajitas  were served scraps of meat also for a mexican food restaurant to serve guacamole from a package is a bad sign,0
great food always service slow tonight but will always come back as we love this place,3
food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks  super rude and condescending  not worth the time or money  stay away,0
we went here based on a random recommendation the chips and salsa were very good the food is quite hot,2
the customer service is horrible which is too bad because the food is great but buttonline is i just cant ever go back customer service is key to enjoying a meal,2
the salsa is excellent and hot last time was better the chimichanga was over done ill go back to the taco next time,2
great spicy nm food,3
amazing customer service  i got the teriyaki chicken wrice lunch special  they had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes  it was great and high quality  ill definitely be returning,4
sothis place is cute  huge dance floor  the whole place is huge geesh  fun decor and nice bartenders  the guys there seem pretty lame though  cool place to get dressed up and dance,2
dont bother with this location they dont carry hardly any inventory online it will say this location has something in stockit doesnt,0
we spent new years eve here great atmosphere excellent food and friendly staff,4
i came here for a night out with my husband and we really enjoyed ourselves  i was a bit disappointed with the patio as i heard it was amazing but i would disagree  we ate upstairs in a nice booth  great food great service  cant really ask for more  but it is a bit expensive for what you get,3
the macadamia but encrusted goat cheese is to die for salads as well nnleap of faith drink is amazing as was our server brandon,4
just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy wow really thats how you treat customers thank goodness there are soo many other great options restaurants who understand what good customer service is,0
we had nye dinner with friends and the food was great the atmosphere reminded us of hawaii the coconut shrimp was the best ive ever had and the filet was perfection just be sure to save room for dessert,4
everything was good with the food while still finishing up with food a lady came up to us and said  we have a reservation pn this tableis there anything that i can do to help you move along it was surprising because the place was empty another recommendation would have been to move us,0
it was good but a bit expensive when theres so many places around town offering the same thing,2
its not fancy asian food but it taste great i compare other thai  asian food to this place never had a bad experience or incorrect order,4
cheap totally get what you pay for buffet was your standard cheap buffet and its definitely in the ghetto,1
what a lovely hotel reminded me of the auckland city new zealand  we had the best time in vegas this place has so many drunk memories attachedi can never forget this place everthe rooms were great neat and tidythe rides on top are not at all scaryits a cool place  over all very good,3
the crispy rice salad with chinese sausage mint and lime is by far the best thing i have ever tasted  i always order 2 portions  if you have to go to vegas god forbid you should check it out,3
best thai food ive ever had try the northern thai menuits very different from typical thai fare nngreat service convenient location even if you need to take a cab nndefinitely worth going,4
i came here with a large party and the service was on point  they were very attentive the food took a while but the restaurant was busy   the food was very savorful and authentic  try it out,3
excellent fresh thai food  do not let the looks of the outside of this place fool you,4
this white boy likes the duck soup,2
take the time to enjoy this little treasure the food was amazing we began conversing with both tables next to us and sharing each others dishes the experience was one of my favorite times while in vegas,3
i double checked to make sure we went to the right restaurant i would rate the food as edible but not good very disappointing after reading all of the reviews wasted money on the cab ride in addition to the bill,1
yummy they offer many authentic thai dishes not offered elsewhere they offer a big selection of alcohol as well the portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it do make a reservation i really liked the hor mok with seabass,3
have had better hibachi for less of a price its ok prob wouldnt go again maybe only if i wanted a quick snack of a couple sushi rolls,2
this used to be a much cooler club however for some reason they changed the name and the decor not bad now but i miss the old one,2
vodka flights  caviar flights  both awesome  try the german caviar  if you want to go extra fancy they have an ice room  did i mention the vodka from all over,4
nostrovia martini a great summer drink and starry night martini like the van gogh painting are both very excellent the ice bar literally and the decor are fantasticmakes me feel like im in russia i love vodka,4
i really liked this bar it had a cool atmosphere and good drinksnni dont exactly remember what i had but i remember it being some kind of pineapple mojito with absinthe in it it was sooooo yummy,2
it was awesome service is what you expected from this type of restaurantnnthe atmosphere was very differant and funnni hope they are around for a long time to come,4
the happy hour martinis are where its at had a few dirty martinis and got a bunch of apps the place looks cool and the bar is made of ice nnservice was excellent bartenders waitress hostess all a,2
we were very excited to go to jasmine after reading the reviews  big disappointment  overly salty nearing inedible rude waiter  short and impatient with my wife our order overall experience will not be back  better service and treatment at restaurants half the price,1
mediocre in every way  service and food  overreliance on salt in the remoulade was a disappointment from this name  the whole place looked tired and past prime,0
terrificly delicious food  good service  very enjoyable atmosphere for a dinner with friends  a terrific meal  i read some negative reviews before going but i found everything to be very good and am glad we chose to go there,4
i had the hubert keller burger and it was gooooooooood and the hazelnut milkshake yuuuuuuuuuum that is all,3
the beers are good  avoid the veggie burger it is mushy and bland,1
food was great but the service was awful we never even got refills on our drinks when we asked numerous times burger was the best part of the experience,1
not bad not great hamburgers are good same level of quality at a lot of bars across america,2
horrible burger pale color no flavor pretty bun but very greasy fries were delicious fresh and hot service was ok for a place called burger anything youd expect good burgers this isnt it,1
yes i love bobby flay and most things food network  i love this place  the scallops are so good  the tamales are so good the steak is so good i am not very good with spicy things  actually i am a huge wimp  but there is plenty on the menu for wimps and it is just all sooo tasty,4
excellent food i had the salmon and it was perfect  i can tell why bobby flay is famous i will be back for more on my next trip to vegas,4
hands down favorite restaurant on the strip  been here multiple times and it keeps exceeding my taste buds and expectations each and every time  try the filet a bit of a kick,4
really amazing food at caesars palace  the tiger shrimp tamale were amazing  i liked the complimentary bread selection  amazing  pork tenderloin sandwich was smokey and delicious  check out what else i ate by visiting my blognnhttpwwwdinedelishcom20110715mesagrillnnthanksnndine delish,3
maybe my expectations were too high  but food was very disappointing  it was ok  nothing spectacular or noteworthy  therefore it was definitely overpriced  wait staff was great though,2
the food was pretty descent for the most part my biggest issue was that they used really bony scrappy cuts of meat for the lamb tenderloin and thought it was ok,2
celebrated  my 60 th birthday here tonight what a fabulous meal we had the shrimp tamale to die for and a duck taco equally as good my husband had the green chili choppino and i had the rabbitt  what a first class meal service was impeccable decore is beautiful maragritas arnt bad either,4
the coffee rubbed filet mignon served with a mushroomancho chile sauce was heaven need i say more,3
the service was exceptionallike nothing ive ever experienced  unfortunately i cant say the same for the food which was borderline inedible  i honestly dont think that i would ever go back even if i were offered a free meal,0
what sandwichs as big as your head with tons of different stuff on themnnawesome beer selection great atmospherennthis place  some friends one of the best times you ever hadnnfyi they are pretty cool about you doing whatever you want to a headwichmore sauce add this extra that,4
make sure youre ready to eat if you come here the proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma the fries that come with the sandwiches are also great,3
food is okay womens bathrooms are nasty my friend had a mouse crawl over his feet sunday 6232013 and when staff was informed they said it had run into the kitchen and someone stepped on it oh okay problem solved never been particularly impressed with service either but that doesnt bother me much,2
i stop by about ounce a month with my wife its out the way for me but well worth it the bay of pigs rocks a must go,4
beers are good as were the wings but the burgers were a big disappointment flavorless and uninteresting  portions were way too bigbordering on ridiculous  service was good  would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it,1
i know im supposed to like the o and that its a tradition but honestly the food is not all that good  i like the fries they are better than average and the portions are huge  my cheesesteak sandwich was not even average and the portion of meat was very skimpy,1
great little find on atwood street the shrimp  corn fritters were super fish the pad thai was very tasty and the malaysian meat quartet covered all the bases,3
the food here is very fresh and very thai  i really enjoyed the red curry with chicken you need to try  ive eaten thai at other places in pittsburgh and there are really no good asian restaurants in pittsburgh anyway and this is the place for thai,4
i was visiting carnegie mellon the day after and i stopped to have dinner here the restaurant had fabulous good and i really really enjoyed the staff thanks for some great food,4
overpriced californiaitalian food  small portions  lunch service is slow  dont expect to be out of there in an hour  patio in the summer is a good place for a leisurely 20 lunch   decent place to take a visitor if you on an expense account,2
very good food but a little pricey so i dropped them back a star the service was excellent,3
overpriced bread was hard the scallops had a lot of grit and very buttery not worth the 30 price a lot of gnats flying around very disappointing,1
not sure what the fuss is  lame sandwiches  much better options on the strip,1
the space is kind of tight and the presentation could be better but the sandwiches are delicious and fulling definately worth the wait for a table,3
parking lot for primanti bros customers ncentralized location downtown in the strip districtnhospitable staff and very homey feelnfast and efficient servicengood pastrami on soft italian bread stuffed with french fries and coleslawnyanits kinda like thatnblack and yellow black and yellow,3
bleh  this place isnt even good when you are drunk,0
carbs carbs and more carbsthis is a horrendous place to eatnsteer as far away from this place as you can nnminus five if allowednnfries on a crummy beef sandwich,0
visited friend john mo in pittsburgh for one night and he brought me heregreat move big fatty sandwich but really really delicious,3
i dont understand when people tell me they love ru sans the sushi is just ok nothing special 80 of the menu is deep fried icknnnot saying i would never go here again but there are sooooo many better places,1
had the fried shallot salmon roll awesome very fair prices and a nice atmosphere cant go wrong,4
fantastic good great service and the only place in the charlotte area i know of to get some real ramen i definitely suggest the sushi as well not overpriced to hell like other places are,4
great sushi i havent try the sushi bar but the sushi rolls are delicious some many kinds of sushi with a touch of originality  no complaints at all in so many years that i been going there,4
best sushi place in charlotte hands down the decor is a bit simple but they more than make it up with the amazing and diverse sushi rolls and friendly energetic staff i have such a great time when i go there it has become a staple for date night with the hubs,4
so ive ordered pizza a couple of times from fuel both times have asked for extra cheese must say pretty lame very thin layer not worth it will look for pizza delivery from someone else,1
its the plaza midwood pizza joint it also has a ms pacmangalaga arcade which i find myself playing most times i visit,3
easily my favorite place to eat in madison  great laothai food  curries are fantastic and make sure to start with a soup  theyre always good  tip place is tiny and you will wait  either get carry out or head across the street to the weary traveler to grab a beer while you wait for your table,4
im jumping on the bandwagon here the squash curry is fabulous nnbrave the willy street construction to get there,3
just wanted to put in a plug for their new food cart on johnson a little east of mills they have squash curry mangopineapple curry and a few sides this is my new favorite food cart in madison fast service good prices and the best curries in madison aside from the brick and mortar locations,4
ive been there only once and that was enough yes it is too crowded and infested with undergrads if you are in for a randomly meeting unattractive people this may be the place for you,1
well its nice  but it could be so much more  the former majestic movie theater turned into a dance club  apparently doing quite well as the premier hip hop dance spot  enjoyed working there dont enjoy drinking there,1
weve some stuff on the menu  burgers a wrap onion rings fries etc and it was all fairly mediorce but reasonably priced at around 78 bucks for dinner  nnbut hey  the hot wings here are amazing  no complaints  theyre perfect  order the wings,3
went there on a friday night in march and had a blast the band playing retro german music was the highlight good beer selection and kitchy waitstaff in lederhosen used loosely here were fun go for the atmosphere not so much for the food,3
the chicken snitchel was the best we got a combo to try weiner chicken and pork chop next time i will get just the chicken snitchel as the flavors were amazing we also started with the beef vegetable souptook me back to my youth in england very authentic the service and atmosphere was great too,4
great gym i loved beckys zumba classes and the functional fitness 6am classes what really made it worth it was cheris helpfulness in regards to membership issues,4
good food with the usual good variety of beer choices available in madison  get there early if youre with a large group the large tables go quickly  as usual for madison bars i love the no smoking law,3
one menu item  bobs organic bad breath burger  you just have to order this  living up to its name you will have bad breath for the rest of the night    but its definitely well worth it,4
best place to eat drink and hang with friends on the isthmus  period,3
cornbread updatenni think they must have tweaked their recipe because i tried a piece of the vegan cornbread again and it was perfect thanks weary bakers,4
fun neighborhood place with good basic bar grub,2
qdoba is ok same idea as chipotle grill but in my opinion the food just doesnt taste as good the burritos dont have that magic ingredient that makes me want to return and i did not dig the decorating scheme  especially the concrete floors and metal tables it feels cold and dark even in the summer,2
great food  atmosphere,4
come for the coffee stay or come back for the excellent fresh soup sandwiches and smoothies  would be 5 stars if the service was more consistent,3
woodmans is the grocery store of the damned  the produce is attrocious and nasty  the lines are always way too long  it seems dirty  its unpleasant in so many ways  it takes forever to shop there  its cheap but id rather pay a few extra cents for a more pleasant grocery store,1
not to be missed on a nice day in summer,4
this bar is probably smaller than your apartment like others have said before its as sconnie as you can get without the hey look how wesconsin i am song and dance  crowd is pretty mixed  over all a fine place to stop by if youre in the neighborhood but not necessarily a destination in itself,2
a definite contender for our winchester our goto neighborhood pub like the winchester in the movie shawn of the dead,2
supremely sticky floors i sat on a bar stool and leaped over the puddles to avoid ruining my shoesnnaccidentally mistook my friend jason from far away and when i said hey jason this shady dude said im not jason but ill certainly be him eeew,1
a small and amazing zoo its free has lots of animals that people children like and  is an easy way to spend a couple hours this easily beats chicagos lincoln park zoo a mustsee,4
the grilled vegetables were limp and steamcooked the vegetarian fajitas had bits of shredded chicken in them the rice was this weird ricearoni takeoff on spanish rice yuck maybe the meat dishes are decent but the vegetarian dishes were at best mediocre i can cook better stuff at home,0
good food friendly staff,2
this place is a madison game day staple the only problem is that this is the case for hundreds of people and that may be modest if you are into ass to elbow people but an incredibly good time this is the spot for you,2
the penang is out of the world jungle curry was really good pad thai was just ok,3
one of the best thai places in town they have great curry as well as noodlebased dishes in addition they have decent alcoholic beverages they also deliver,4
the kona coffee is a personal favorite for my coffee for my hubby  we love the banana crepes and monte cristo  i also love the chicken strip salad,3
i like this place  i dont get a chance to go very often but every time i go its always good  i always have the seared tuna  great place to sit outside and eat when it is cooler,3
sweet place  thats all i have to say,4
this is simply a holiday inn in disguise dont expect anything more except the flat screen haha and you will not be disappointed,0
i really enjoy coming here they have great lunch time specials but try their vino bambino salad its amazing their pizzas are really good too for dessert make sure to have their pizookie,3
this place has gone down hill in the past couple of years corporate has changed the quality of their pasta in order to save money the only thing that really tasted good was the cheese bread i havent been back since,0
staff was very friendly and atmosphere was fun but the margherita pizza thin crust was the worst i have ever had mozzarella was so thin you couldnt even taste it tasted like cardboard,2
the skinny encountered rude staff nnthe fat pit stop the mall seemed decent but because its also arizona they get a one star anyway i absolutely hate dealing with rude staff,0
excellent food and causual atmosphere  we visited as a group of three from portland or  we enjoyed the quesadilla poblano chilis tomato salad pulled pork tamales and margaritas  the service was excellent and the food was delectable   na friend in portland referred me and im glad she did,4
i cant say that anything was great at los sombreros  the margaritas were bland the salsa is not like any salsa ive ever seen before the chicken tacos were tasteless  ill never go back there againalthough our waitress was darling and attentive,0
food was good and the portions were large good place overall but probably would have been better with kids good place thanks,2
they seriously have the coolest set up  ambiance but it ends therennfood is overpricednnhardly any healthy optionsnnservers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything,1
the noiselights and animals are merely a coverup for the slow service lackluster food and expensive dishes dont expect to add a house salad to your 1248 turkey wrap ladies and gents here they want 449 to add it as a side 37 later we wont come again,1
this place gets 5 stars for atmosphere and it is a favorite of my children for that reason  however the service always seems to be lacking in one way or another  the food is ok and overpriced for what you get  but due to the fun environment we will keep going back,2
nice hotel and best bang for the buck,4
very old dated and unbelievably smokey  our company had a conference there the conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross,0
not very clean and rooms smell funny not geared for thwarting younger crowd,1
we were on our way home from 4 nights at the rio and ran into traffic at stateline so we turned around and stayed a night at here we had a great time kids saw a movie excellent poker room and the courtyard cafu00e9 was pretty good next trip were going to stay here,3
old hotel and casino but it has a lot of nice qualities the arena has hockey and there is a bowling ally and arcade for kidsnnthe buffet is good and reasonably priced the gator bar has the cheapest drinks in vegas im convinced ask for spider,2
i maintain my disdain for the palms  i was here last week and the service was just awful  i was overall unhappy with my stay,1
lots to do in the hotelcasino but its just so isolated from the strip,2
very low quality room off the strip if your looking to stay at a party hotel with people passed out in the hall  ways and benches out front this is your place we stayed at the place and it was terrible and the room was half way cleaned checking in,1
the rooms are nice a little dull but nice the big bathroom even in entry level rooms are a massive plus and if you like to soak in a deep tub you will be very happy the rest of the casino is nice enough but i think next time i will head back to my usual hangout which is the mirage,3
i think the rooms need an update i mean for the price theyre not spectacular staff were really nice thoughnnthe casino and barclubrestaurant choices are fine typical las vegas nnthe lobby is gorgeous but you dont have to stay there to see it,2
wow this place is pricey but fun well we at here for dinner and saw mike tyson just know when he comes in  everyone was like wow mike tyson is here but you know what   he is a man just like any other man he is just a famous boxer but he would like to  eat  in a public place and he want  to just eat,3
wifi doesnt work in many of the public areas  youd expect them to get it right,2
love the shopping here and the best part for us was the water show every 15 minutes at night and was a site to see always saw it tv and seeing it live was an experience not a gambler so cant comment on the casinos but the shops and the views here were great,2
in my opinion this hotelcasino is overrated  we stayed at the cosmopolitan for about the same price and were on the 65th floor overlooking the bellagios fountains  at the bellagio we overlooked the poolnnthe pool is nice and hugennthe carpet decor and furnishings are all old and dated,1
stayed here many times but truly nothing special wife has never been so took her for her b day nice rooms and grounds but there is better for less money pool and hot tub close at 400 wth staff is very friendly and attentive,2
restaurants dont provide many gluten free or veggie options elevator nazis are rude wifi in rooms is incredibly slow this place is stuck in 1998,2
excellent experience sharon upgraded my already upgraded room  next thing i knew doorbell rings and walks in a server with a bottle of wine  also received a 100 dollar certificate to spend on anything i want along with 120 in breakfast certificate  nnall this is thanks to american express card,4
a four star hotel really the rooms felt like a high class motel  dark and definitely past its prime days if this was an upgraded room i wonder what the original must have looked like nnat least it was clean and comfortable so cant really complain except its not worth the star rating at all,1
terrible weve stayed at other mgm resorts and they were all better regardless of price than this one,0
this hotel was horrible the staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious if i had a fridge or microwave i would have said 5 star if you like that sort of thing stay here as for me im not staying here again til the next time,3
the fun atmosphere and nice staff plus a great room with an awesome view cant make up for food poisoning from the america restaurant  i didnt want to spend my vacation in the bathroom  we will try a different hotel next time we go to las vegas,0
this place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price  theres lots of neat stores including hersheys the music is pretty good this place is good for a gambler on a budget foodwise,2
stayed here on my first visit to vegas  my friend worked for hilton at the time and got the rooms for free so why not  found it to be pretty decent  the thing is this place is off the strip and that made it a major pita,1
feels dated with a hint of ghetto low ceilings in rooms reminds me of a better circus circus with less ghettoness,1
let us check in at 9am friendly staff  decor a bit old but very clean  looking forward to our stay,3
cheap pricing decent roomsnparadise cafe has decent foodnbeds are comfortable recommend player card for gamblingnnnna little far from strip,2
nice little casino went here for raiding the rock vault,2
i like their buffet small but all the food very good except for the salmon which used to be good also sadly missed the lamb chops they used to put out  never a wait to eat at the buffet  fairly priced for the quality they have all the beer and  wine you can drink,3
this place is a rundown neglected dump staff was not friendly at all and my room smells like raw sewage but i dont want to wait another hour in the checkin line,0
lackluster hotel that should have been torn down years ago stained carpets long check in lines tattered decornnthere are too many other places to stay in vegas to justify staying at the lvh,1
waaaaaaay too much smoke in the casino yucknand very very low ceilings  very claustrophobic,1
meh place but it was the cheapest and best located decent hotel to staynif you can afford it try the newer hotels,2
can i give this place zero stars  8500 for a deluxe pedicure and it was the worst quickest wambam thankyou mam pedicure  horrible  they wont be getting another dime of my money  if i could give this place zero stars i would,0
good place to stay but dont gamble here the payouts are horrible compared to freemont street tropicana and the station nice pool on top of casino area beds werent that great shower was pretty nice great central location not bad for the price nice lively atmosphere good bang for buck hotel,3
good location the room was fairly nice overall a ok nice cafes inside as well decent food,2
i wouldnt go to this hotel i went to las vegas many many times check out my pictures i go to the best and worst hotels this hotel is 2 thumbs down,0
this place does offer good sushi and prefixed menu but it is definitly way over rated for the price they are asking i would expect the fish to taste as good as the fishes in tsukiji fish market in tokyo,2
when i die  i want to come back as a black cod with misonnwhy you might asknnso that when someone eats me i can give back the warm fuzzy feeling i get from this dish  whoa  nnhands down offthehook delish  bring your ass here  and dont forget the benjamins,4
obviously the sushi is good but the atmosphere is blah  you can get great sushi at many other places that are less expensive and with better vibes  here youre paying for the name,2
super expensive but holy cow thats some delicious fish,4
overrated really i have to say it,1
best misoyaki butterfish i ever had  the sake which i cant remember the name was also great  i dont know why i have less of an issue dropping some  on high end japanese food than high end chinese food  hmmmm,3
great atmosphere and food but a little pretentious over priced even for vegas and waiters have been trained to upsell you,2
this place is decent good price for the strip and its a nonnightmare all in all a good experience not stellar but definitely good at least the casinos and bars inside were good i am a big fan of the pub and the zowie bowie show,2
old hotel but always filled with guest and tourists the jaba was a great addition to this hotel,3
where i lost most of my money but this review is for the horrible service i was provided sure the jabbawockeez show wasnt bad and britney spears sat a couple rows behind my sister but this place is so grungy and needs to keep up with the architecture come see me at the bellagio,1
really liked this place  it had a nice layout of the casino floor it was not smokey and it had a very open feel to it  well kept up  stop by and say hi,3
bad servicenpubic hair and make up on clean towelndirty roomn3 out of 3 restaurants on propertyndelivered substandard food quality and serviceninsect in bed see photonwill never returnnenough said,0
i havent stayed here but ive been inside hotel looks really nice nice lobby and very well decorated its located at a descent location on the strip however their casino isnt the best if you are a gambler might wanna hit up some other casinos,2
good price for a beautiful hotel in the middle of the strip  love this place  the lobby was clean and the lines for the front desk went fastnnwe politely asked for something close to the elevator no matter the view and they gave us a room by the elevator with a great view  bonus on ncustomer service,4
moderately priced located at the south end of the strip pool area is nice but was dirty and crowded food wrappers in the pool rooms had a good view but poor soundproofing no wifi and no fridge unless you upgrade to the deluxe rooms,2
we got the spa suite no complaints i love the medium sized refrigerator no microwave though,3
rooms were very old they need to update it the casino and hotel itself was not bad,1
i loved every minute of this show nnplain and simplennit was awesome nnloved the interpretations the symbols the movements the music the costumes the comedic relief zumanity showed all the different sides  angles in sexnncant wait to go a 2nd time this time front row booth baby,4
soo good this is the 2nd cirque show i have seen and it did not disappoint not for the uptight or prude,3
great actingespecially the mctypical cirque quality  did this instead if believe after reading the reviews  glad i did  definitely enjoyable as a couple,4
this was fun got a little board at times,2
just funshow up 45 minutes early it is hilarious i had no clue what is was when i wentleft laughinggreat showopen minded adults only as it gets into the other side of humanity,4
hahahahahahahahaha looking for a good time finding yourself in new york new york spend the money bring your honey you might find yourselves on stage and if you dont you get to watch someone elses awkwardness on stage its a good time,3
how can you not love this show if your in vegas and an open mind this show will not disapoint and you might get lucky with your date afterward,3
i liked this show alot it was great there is something for guys and girls even big girls got love which is a surprise bbws walking around giving out strawberries was cool my wife and i had a good time watching this show,3
this was different than the other cirque de soleil  shows in a sense that its a combination of acrobatics meets stand up comedy  all while being sexual at the same time  i enjoyed it and was very much entertained,3
fun spicy and beautifulni really enjoyed this show and if you think which show to see in vegas this is kind of musttodo in las vegas zumanity is the onenps i heard that there are some discounts for military,4
this show was awful  ive been to many cirque shows and i have no idea how they allow this show to exist  there were minimal acrobatics just a lot of toplessness and bad jokes  thats 88 and 2 hours of my life ill never get back,0
its not what i expected if you want real luxury in vegas stay at bellagio or palazzo,2
best hotel in vegas  yes  have i been to all the hotels in vegas  nonnive been to some and this is as good as it getsnni want to live here,4
this place is great to walk around anyone into art needs to check this place out,3
after they cancelled my reservation for no reason embarrassing me in front of my group i will never stay here again  nsadcause it was my favorite hotel and recommended it highly to all who were coming to vegas,0
didnt stay there but best casino ladies room on the strip  we tried em all at some point,4
my goto hotel with my girls been here so many times that i am sick of grand lux cafe altho the food is good and its open 247 the rooms are spacious well priced and location is great they have a coffee bean which is great 2 stars only 1 star is that wifi is not free,3
i love it here stayed here for 3 nights in mid junennsuite was huge couldnt have asked for more it was just perfectnnwe will definitely stay here again,4
this was my favorite place on the strip a nice chance plus a calming feeling in a city of constant noise and chaos even in the crowd i felt i had my own experience here great place to shop eat visit or play check it out,4
still nice after all these years  though the indooroutdoor thing is still a little creepy,3
checkincheckout is really slow and crowded with the huddled masses public areas are very smokey restaurants are over priced wish we had stayed at the venetian,1
ill keep it short nice hotel for the price and great pool area close to all the good stuff,2
box office service sucks,0
unhip clientele  bar staff that are rude as hell  not even a good center bar to hang out at  why was i here all of friday night  im not really sure oh yeah cheap tickets to their nightclub  all i know is i left mirage thinking id only be back there to see beatles love again  this place is so weak,1
the price was good for the strip and the location was centrally located the free valet was a nice relief the staff was friendly and the room was cleannndefinitely pay the extra money to upgrade and get a view of the strip and volcano from your room if you have the option,3
room cleanliness dnvalet parking cnresort charge fnbathroom cleanliness dnlocation bnfront desk cnnoverall this hotel was built in 1989 the updates that they have attempted to do are done in poor quality and taste unfortunately i rank this place a d overall,1
used to be a cheesy place but now its classy and centrally located its rather affordable too,3
bed bugsbeware infested and never reported,0
you dont get much for your player card status at mirage  wifi internet access in the hotel room is terrible which you are paying for with a resort fee,1
a lot of people love the mirage im not a big fan nni like it there its okay its in a decent location it has some good restaurants some bars and other things it just doesnt tickle my fancy much maybe its the middleaged vibe it feels older the crowd is older and everything seems a little worn out,2
pros clean basic rooms the adjacent door was convenient free wifi good location on the strip  especially good since it was right where the finish line for the rock n roll half marathon woot nncons wasnt the biggest fan of the lobbyfound it a bit dimly lit not lively and didnt put me in the best mood,2
was having a great time until i realized they house six captive dolphins was shockedthey are literally in a swimming pool really sad no thanks ill stay elsewhere next time,0
maybe because im use to ny steakhouses but i was disappointed ni was with a party of 10 for lunch lunch menu was great however my steak was over cooked nnwheres the porterhouse steaksnnwine was good but little expensive even for vegas,1
this is what every restaurant aspires to beperfectneverything is perfect each and everytimeni have been going for what ten years maybentheir steaks are always cooked to what exactly you ask forni love this place,4
the bone in ribeye was freakin delicious  i am glad had a good experience at my first emeril restaurant  hopefully my next one will be commanders palace in 2 years  woot woot,4
great service great decor and ambiance but food was weak  wedge salad had undercooked fatty bacon on top roast duck was overdone not juicy but skin was rubbery  lots of folks do it better than delmonico keep looking,1
i didnt get a chance to eat here but the mojitos were absolutely divine they make their own rum in house and could easily be the elixir of the gods worth the time every time highly recommend,3
great service excellent menu their chateaubriand steak was mouthwatering,3
very good excellent sides tasty food,3
good for the management to reach out and connect with me  i hope they are sincere in making an effort to make this establishment a better experience for everyone,2
best strip club in vegas becausenn1 two minutes from the stripn2 evil vampire barbies galoren3 wood paneling  and framed paintings  oh myn4 very russian mafia but clean cut rich russian mafia at leastn5 free taxi ride but remember you cant take these toys home with you,4
im just tagging along with my friends and their menz  there are naked chicks everywhere there are horny guys everywhere there is booze everywhere there is me wishing i was dancing on my own dance floor there i go out the door to be my own star on another dance floor the end,2
the room and the pool was just average altough the lazy river was really long nothing special here concierge service was not very helpful a better bet for the south strip would be mandalay bay or the hotel if your wallet can take it,2
we stay here but the bathroom door lock was broken  the room was nice the hotel was big  alot of stuff to see but our view wasnt great because we were looking at the back side of the hotel all we to check out was the room and parking  we should of  ask for a view,2
was a great hotel and love the fact that i got 40 off my ka tickets but when it comes to the small things it sucks like no free wireless internet no fridge and no microwave but i still had a great time,2
over the years i have stay at the mgm many times and never have had a problemthe checkin staff and the dealer to the pit bosses are all pretty nice nnthey send me free room offer all the timestay 2 nights for free a couple of weeks ago rooms are nice and clean,3
good visit to vegas recently disappointed with mgm service is not good anywhere we went at mgm over priced for the quality we cruised most of the other hotels and casinos on the strip and mgm wont get my business next time not that they were bad but their competitors were certainly better,1
1 star,0
stayed here for 2 weeks had a group of 20 staying here i didnt like the place  rooms where outdated  casino was always busy and couldnt enjoy myself so spent the whole trip at other casinos,1
love this place its great for all ages and dont get me started on how comfortable the beds are the service is fast and very responsive,4
i had had two drinks and the slot lady cut me off i had two drinks after 5 hours the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me i was only able to drink water this place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay stay away,0
they get zero stars we have had our suite now booked for 5 months we go to check in and they tell us sorry you have been down graded wtf what hotel does this never book here you dont know what you till you check in,0
stay away this place is just a huge time share and they promise you the moon and after hours of what should be considered torture you feel emotionally drained i wish i would have spit on the guy that stopped me in the street instead of give him the time of day,0
i walked here from the strip because i thought it would be an adventure and it was  nngot to see some cool and at times strange live musicnnalso got to see the last band of the night get kicked out of the establishmentnnstickers everywhere,4
ridiculously great bartenders nfrom noon til 5 monday through friday you can have any drink in the bar for 2nthey have slim jims and twinkiesnfree shows all the damn time,4
this place is super fun music is hella loud and the drinks are so heavy you cant ask anything better,4
booked the place they put us on the last room before they remodeled entire hotel find out the last day wasnt pleasant experience,1
this is a great place to stay  just got back from a weekend here and it is in a great location on the strip we got the room for a good price and i thought the casino downstairs was pretty fun  the staff is also very nice especially since they bring you lots of free drinks when youre gambling,3
this was a very oridnary hotel nothing especial it did not match our expectation of a four star hotel in vegas we stayed there for one night then for the same price we got another hotel that was much better,1
brings me lots luck here specially the 777 slot machines,3
stayed here for 1 night and the room was really nice the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size my only complaint was that there was no outlet by the nightstand to charge my phone,3
i write this with a heavy heart everything was fine but bed bugs attacked me  and i am no diva but this made me sad anyway to sanitize beds otherwise a ok,1
for the pool140 for cabana which wasnt badservice was horrible they honestly had 34 girls for the entire pool to include cabana patrons  music was good overall not a bad way to spend an afternoon,2
since ditching the pirate theme ti is hotel with identity crisis  not impressed with the room which had broken fixtures  loud ac  spa is a joke which have to pay 17 extra  only plus is good location  stay at rio for 50 less and much better room,1
this is a pretty crappy and old hotel the room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags  the bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed i had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets,1
the shower drain was cloggedthe rooms arent that great but if youre a poor college student or poor postgradthen its not that bad  great location,0
this place reeks of desperation with our buffet of buffets pass we decided to try their dining room i felt sad sitting in their outdated facilities eating school cafeteria food we lasted there a few minutes and then decided to hightail it out of there for a happier eating experience,0
the most disgusting repulsive filthy dishonest poorly run hotel on the face of the earth i would not stay here again if i were paid 10000,0
for the price and location  not a bad value but i wouldnt stay here again i saw checkin lines go well over an hour during my stay it looked like the airport tsa line on a bad day just wouldnt be worth it to start a weekend with that experience,1
it seems like they dont clean their rooms  a friend of mine stayed here and saw the conditions of their room im like can we pregame in mine lolnnget a remodel like ti did  nnthe only reason why you even get a star is because i have to and you have hash house a go go,0
great rates and a great restaurant for breakfast been here twice nmight have been more kinda hazy but from what i remember it was a good place to lay  my head,3
i would do zero stars if i could  horrible noisy dirty dusty experiencenstaff was awful service was worse  nbooked on lasvegascom and they didnt stand behind their service  ill never book with them again  not sure ill ever go to vegas again,0
obviously its not the best place to stay when youre in vegas but you know what the service staff is nice and the location is great smack dab in the middle of the strip if you dont want to spend a lot of  on a hotel room this is the place for you,1
i dont get it its about time they tore down this casino and put up a real one,0
this is pretty poor french food  i had the onion soup which was honestly the worst ive ever had in my life  i also tried to get them to make me a crepe complet egg ham cheese and they pretty much failed  sad,1
great little resturaunt right outside the paris hotel with a nice view we had breakfast and the service and food was great,3
the steak here was very good and cooked perfectly i love the fried potatoes that come with the meal i think my favorite part was the bread and the foie gras would def come here again when i get the chance,3
the snails and bread were good otherwise dont eat dinner here  slimy undercooked farmed salmon and greasy cheesy pasta  no one at our table liked the various other entrees great view of the strip though,1
i am not familiar with the french restaurants but i guess this place is ok escargot could have been cooked better though,2
the service and atmosphere was first rate and the food was very tasty  we have enjoyed  mon ami gabi in other cities but this location definately stands out,3
great spot to eat outside and watch the fountains great food although since its french it can be a bit heavy love the steaks and the onion soup,4
nice view of bellagio and the watershow romantic environment friendly staff and great foodnni just wish it wasnt so darn expensive  a plate of small caesar salad is already 9,3
first of all its in front of the bellagio where you can watch the water show while dining well if ure seated outside i love the food the waiter recommended a drink and it was delicious will def go back here next time im in vegas,3
food is good but a little pricey for the quality  the best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by,2
nice street side seating enjoyed the brunch eggs benedict and bloody mary bar overall a good experience and would return,2
lobster roll was great try their french onion soup i need to go back and experience more of the food the seating was pretty good service was great,2
still my favorite meal since i moved to las vegas 7 years ago  and ive had many wonderful meals here the french onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock the filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious highly recommend,4
great atmosphere prime location across from the bellagio water fountain show prices are as expected for being on the strip ive had better thoughthats the reason for three stars,2
not very impressed  for the price and location i was expecting a lot more,2
steak frites have a pesto like butter sauce on themnvery accomodating staff for our 3 childrennquiche is divine im still thinking of it,2
so freaking good sangria amazing escargots delicious onion soup amazing scallops i could eat all day fresh bread at the table still warm i love this place,4
was lazy in planning and didnt make reservations in time for anyplace better  first time visit here for me last saturday night  nnfood was just okay especially considering the prices  i guess youre paying for the view of the bellagio fountain across the street,1
effeciency of ordering and care hiccough only with reservation when i arrived which was quickly amended great food and view,4
the best place in vegas with the most beautiful view of the bellagio food was great service was excellent the bread is too die forall in all one of the best places on the strip,4
get the streak frites  that is all you need to know,3
service was slow had to send entree back to the kitchen because it was overcooked food was very bland,0
love the atmosphere  its best to get their late in the afternoon when the bellagio fountains go off and stay to watch the sun go down as the lights of the strip come on,4
dont go here for breakfast both mine and my husbands food was very greasy cool and not very tasty i usually find it difficult to screw up breakfast but this place found a way the service was also slow the 40 spent on some coffee and a few eggs was the worst 40 i spent in vegas i will not be back,0
had a beautiful dinner on the patio overlooking the fountain show for my birthday with loved ones  each and every part of our experience was fantastic  this will be one of the best french meals youll ever have,4
wherever you are eat where locals eat this is not one of themservice is terrible  and food is a long way from being 100 french just another tourist trap,0
love their french onion soupnlove their sea food platternlove their oystersnlove their wine selectionnlove sitting on the balcony on a warm evening night people watchingnncheers,4
best steak ive ever had best customer service affordable lux food,4
food and service were wonderful and the tomato salad and rack of lamb which i ordered rare magnificent  only complaint was the steady thumpthump of the music if you can call it that which sounded like a grim heartbeat  the most depressing sound ive ever heard as background to a fine french dinner,3
chill spot if you wanna get away from the big club scene got in for free and there was no dress code place is a bit smallnndj played hiphop at first then changed to rave music no thanksnni would have gave an extra star if they played hiphop all night,2
were not all whales flown in from japan on gulfstreams for us 1 blackjack the casino is pretty ghetto and all but you get free drinks to wager pennies at a time i like this place when you want to kill time waste a little money and get drunk,4
want to stay on the strip but youre a cheapskate sahara is the place for younnold  falling apart  terrible shows   great characternnonly problem is its a little too far away from the heart of the strip,2
i did not stay here i did however happen to hit up the buffet the last time i was in vegas disgusting ended up being scared away from all buffets because of this one and the nascarredneck theme is just plain stupid nyeehaw,0
mirrored ceilings checknfluorescent rainbow lights checknvegas eye candy checknhot tub  fireplace combo check npeppermills on the table check nnyeah this place is sweeeeet  and they make a blt with avocadoblat,3
vintage vegas at its best the retaurant is cool but the lounge is awesome perfect latenight spot for couples,4
meh a little on the greasy side went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous the food was decent on par with dennys or cocos aside of the huge portions im a fan of the large coffee mugs though,1
disgusting portions of cheap and unhealthy grub and long lines,0
this is the best place to go after the club the food is pretty good not the the best but it works when your intoxicated lol,3
the peppermill is one of the oldest and most established late night eateries in town the service is always great and expedient the peppermill is a great place to grab a bite at any time of the day,2
food is alright not bad for a dennys variant but servicei get better service at mcdonalds,1
this review will be quick and to the point  open 24hrs nngo hungry  leave extremely full,3
walked throughout here to check out their gambling scene and they seriously need an update everything looked very old and worn out the atmosphere was very dead and dull was not excited to try and gamble here at all,1
really chill hotel no complaints from me,3
oh man what a disappoint the lunch buffet really needs a visit from chris angel because its in need of a magic show make this food disappear,1
casino na little on the older side but overall great slot machines and table games  nnlove the upgraded modern rooms and the prices are reasonable for being on the strip and centralized to a lot of restaurants and shoppingnnthe staff is always nice,2
dilapidated overpriced loud dowdy cheap spring break crowd wait in line for everything 4 for a little bottle of dasani service is indignanti mean why go here,0
casino is decent pool is fun rooms due for revamp the suite i was in had water damage from hottub in room with furniture peeling apart  when i called the front desk they said all the rooms were like that o,2
three words 5 resort fee what is a 5 resort fee you ask some madeup  charge they tack onto your bill because they realized that they didnt really want to charge you what they advertised on their website,0
rickety ticketythis place is like a hot looking woman with failing organsthe outside looks greatbut the inside is crapthe rooms are evidently outdatedclosets with loose hingesfaded du00e9cordust must and rustnnon a positive noteits cheapand in vegasall you really need is a place to crash,2
crappy hotel with crappy scary elevators everything are outdated and worn out crt tv and no wifi,0
they have let this hotel fall apart the elevators are scary from all the shaking and squealing the floors are dirty the paint is peeling  the room smelled like weed and the cocktail waitress only serve the tables other than that i loved the room and the staff was friendly,1
nice rooms but id only return id there was a coffee maker in the room if the want you to get up and gamble they shouldnt make guests wait in the 40  people long line at either starbucks for overpriced drip,0
i stayed here on an offnight and it was only around 40 bucks loved the room we had with the view and the hot tub both the exterior and interior of this hotelcasino are really cool looking criss angels show is here and its a fun one to watch no real complaints,3
i was a little disappointed my room kind of sucked and the hotel service was a little off we had fun gambling here and there is a really fun bar to get the night started but all in all i dont plan in stating here again,2
do not come here a million hidden fees i had to pay to recieve a package that was sent to me ridiculous,0
older but comfy  great for the you get crowdbe sure to eat at the taco  tequila bar,1
the hotel is good but the buffet is horrible my husband and i got sick after we left after dinner overall i liked the room and casino avoid buffet,1
just checked in and found out that theres no wifi in the room no hdtv and youd think theyd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on veterans day weekend  never stay here again,1
be sure to take photos of your room before you leave the added on a bs charge for two damaged room phones and a broken door lock  400 for two phones i didnt even touch ridiculous  never going back to any of the mgm mirage properties ever again,0
great place to stay rooms are spacious and clean the price is fair its at the end of the strip so theres less foot traffic which is a blessing the air is cleaner vs other hotels lots of things to do in the hotel beach mall bars clubs spa many others,3
the rooms are nice especially the ones facing the strip its defiantly a gorgeous view of the whole strip the highlight of this place if the giant wave pool lazy pool private cabanas and then the public pool a great area to relax and enjoy the sun and have some drinks,3
had a very difficult time getting into the hotel between the valet being full registration very crowded with only a couple staff working the desk slow service in the restaurant and lots of early morning noise from the housekeeping group in the hallways,0
very nice place great restaurant and bars i love how they infuse the air with a coconutty smell like suntan lotion better then cigarette smoke the staff is nice and helpful,3
i loved mandayay bay resort  casino it was clean beautiful fun our room was georgous  so much to do there good entertainment good food had a great time and we will go back soon,4
this pace is just awesome  the smell the action the excitement the food the pool  all there and reachable by a free tram from excalibur  its by far one of the top 3 casinos in vegas,4
pools room nice place lots of fun the pools are allot of fun  fun fun fun,4
ventilation is horrible i feel like i smoked 3 packs of cigarettes just walking across the casino need major upgrade,0
i guess each hotel has to have something of its own to separate them from others and what makes mandalay bay one of the ultimate places for having a great time outdoors is their big artificial looking beach kick back relax enjoy the water and the live dj music,4
note that this is now the desert rose resort  ive stayed here several times over the years and consider it one of the very best deals for basic condostyle rooms within walking distance of the strip you can walk to the tropicana the mgm grand and the monorail stop behind the mgm,2
stayed here in 2009nbesides a roach being in our room and the staff providing us with spray so that we could handle the problem ourselves it was a nice stay the staff overall was kind and helpful and the resort was very close to the strip,2
this is a real letdown of a steakhouse  are they even serving prime beef  i really hope so but cant tell from their steaksnnthat being said their kobe burger is pretty good for lunch and you can get sushi as your side  talk about a decadent vegas lunch  its my signature,2
do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a 50 ribeye with a dull steak knife  my only memory of this place is having to saw my steak,1
side dishes were good but the new york strip was the worst i ever had very disappointing this type of restaurant should be top notch skip it,1
great meal highly recommend this place the chefs menu is the way to go you will not go away hungry,4
the best steak house on the strip  the roasted steaks are great  fries should not be missed  quite expensive  awesome service  incredible wine list study it before you dine,4
ive eaten here twice now the service has been outstanding the steaks good the braised short ribs are to die for,3
didnt live up to the hype  my steak was ok but all the accompaniments were over salted and the potatoes were underdone  we tried the arugula salad heirloom tomatoes asparagus along with the filet and chicken  steak was well crusted but not enough to carry the meal,1
me and my business partner had dinner there last night ordered the chief special with kobe ribeye and my partner ordered the filet both were good nothing to rave over thou i would expect better quality for the price and would probably choose a different steak house next time,2
divine  that really sums it up  have the hanger steak  it is simple perfection and honestly enough for two  tender with the juices perfectly sealed in  i dream of my next visit to vegas and another amazing meal here,4
the chicken tacos were the bomb  i havent had such good tex mex in a while and this is up there the guac was great toobecause i went on a sunday i also got to laugh at all the drunk tourist coming out of rehabboy oh boywhat a fun sunday,3
this place suckedthe service was terrible only went because my niece raved about the place we got there and waited almost 20 mins before we saw our waitress the food was pricey for what seemed to be everyday mexican food but the service was just terriblei was not impressed at all,1
wow stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas i am not exaggerating when i say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm the drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later we drank we left we wont be back,1
i went here for dinner  i had the steak with risotto i ate it allnnit was good meh  it was good  i dont know  i feel like im trying to convince myself that it was indeed good because i wanted it so much for it to be really good but it was good,2
i must have ordered the wrong thing for breakfast  i had a typical breakfast dish with eggs and bread and there was nothing to rave about  there was a large selection to choose from but nothing to say wow,2
excellent meal and high quality service  had an excellent chicken and fries meal and a fantastic salad  though this was way better than joel robuchon  also much chiller with nice bar dining area if you are not interested in a table or doing vegas solo,4
service is soooo slow food is good but nothing spectacular go to grand lux for beignets instead,1
do not go here king of like maggianos i hate it huge factory we had bad experience with almost everything we ordered if u love french fries then this is your placenwe both got sick after,0
i was a little out of my element at this high class restaurant but it was worth the trip  we went for breakfast and tried the chicken and waffles  the baked chicken and gravy was fantastic  the service was top notch,3
fine place to go if you want a casual dinner but dont expect much more  well priced many options everything good but nothing amazing  loud atmosphere service fine if youre looking for a more celebrity chef type restaurant you can easily find better options,2
breakfast decent filled omelet nice crisp bacon coffee stronger than american but weaker than real french disappointingly ordinary brioche toast fawning service prices not too heinous considering the location but its really about as french as olive garden is italian,2
if youre staying at venetian its hard to eat anywhere else for brunch i mean this place was literally on our way out of the room they have a nice patio surrounded by fountains and the omelets are different every day,3
place has gone down hill  total tourist trap for deep wallets andor suckers  the ones in ny and boston are fantastic  to be fair service was excellent  thats about it  food was bland at best,1
good dayna week before christmas we arrived in las vegas  visiting our daughter who lives in the areantruly memorable  great food  excellent service and the fountain show was so sweet christmas songs great food  wonderful ambience nwill definitely be back,3
get some late night dessert here and receive free entry to the club the desserts here are so pretty that youll have to take a picture before you take a bite too bad the dessert doesnt make up for the lame club there have here afterwards the music is wack and i just cant dance to wack music,1
best food in vegas all natural fresh healthy and tasty,4
not that great very busy and it seemed every store i entered was out of what i was looking for  parking is horrible as well  i dont plan on ever going back to this place  i gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer,1
always a fan of outlets  especially when they carry name branded stores tory burch lacoste nike factory etc it was really crowded when we went  given it was st patricks day nnfirst time here though next time were going to explore the south one,3
far too many people and long lines both for counters and and fitting rooms try find other premium outlets for example near los angeles,1
this is a very nice place to find any clothing you can never think of from any brand install the pricing is very depend on what you want to buy nyour tourist and you come to town to the right place for you to find the best deal from all the different stores nvery recommended,4
lots of shopping came to buy thingsnndodged asian tourist to get to storesnnspent money  would do again,3
this place had terrible service the morning that i went and its not worth it for the price we paid  it was just oki wouldnt go back,1
all i remember is a huge and delicious chicken nacho there was so much cheese that the waitress actually brought us extra chips to scoop it up and it was ridiculously cheap ill go back sometime and see if other dishes are as good,2
777 thats it you dont wanna try anything else best steak ever never disappoints youmy favorite late night dinning place,4
its the hard rock hotel cafe  you eat here because its convenient  they charge in accordance of that,1
this place has gone to shits  the food sucks and the service is horrible  it used to be good but now its the worse dont go coz the food is not good n dry n disgusting sorry to say,0
what a downerended the evening herefoodjust regular ole bar foodnothing specialdrinks just averagewater tasted good and fairly priced,1
the best sushi i had in vegas definitely a five star experience for vegas,4
perhaps this place was having an off night because the sushi i ordered was nothing spectacular  rice was incredibly dry and it really just didnt taste that great  good cocktails though and the edamame is always sure to please regardless of where you are  nncant say i would ever go back,1
ok the two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it wtf dont they clean the floors but the bartenders did make me forget about the nastiness with the strong and cheap drinks that was the only reason it didnt get one star id go back if im in champaign again,1
really should deal with their rotten trash dead animal smell havent been there for a while and hope they improve it,0
their beer sampler is fun way to sample their good beers and have fun at the same time i thought their fish fry was really good toonnif youre going to dine there during warm month try the pretty outside garden seating and make sure to share appetizer with friends for start of a nice evening to ensue,3
a big menu and most of the food is pretty solid they brew their own beer on site and my favorites are the stone of scone scotch ale and crop circle wheat this is a good place to take a big group of people and is in a cool historic building i highly recommend eating on the patio its really nice,3
just dont eat at the one in the airport cold food,0
new mexico chile soup salad and beer bread  yum german sausage plate  yes chocolate paired with beer  you cant leave without tasting the tri pepper pairing whats not to like pub food does not have to be greasy frat food thank you great dane for a fabulous lunch,4
the candle has some awesome pizza combinations and i love their thin crust the veggie pizza was delicious with the fresh spinach and basil shredded over top yum another up side was ordering by the slice nice if youre not hungry enough for a whole pizza but still need to feed the craving,3
after reading so many positive reviews i expected much more from this place  while the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good the rest of our experience was unimpressive  there are many other restaurants i would visit before considering a return to eno vino,1
worth the money youll probably see celebrities here you have to get there early to ensure entry,4
hella stuffynhella no space to dancenloooonnnggeessst wait ever in my life even my party was on the guestlist,0
this is a really beautiful club with beautiful people unfortunately it was packed to the gills for the memorial day weekend so it made it a little uncomfortable at times however it was still a fun time,3
love great staff cool vibe good lookin cats and probably had the best vegas dj spinnin the night i went dj casanova nnwe had a table on the rooftop and were taken care of very well security guards were very nice and the waitress was cute ill be coming back here every time i come to vegas,4
got in free before 12am one wkend  the club is smaller than i expected like the dancefloor which is weird  crowded at times and hot lol theres other vip rooms but the decor is nice,2
this was the best stop that nite tours provided  dug the music and the crowd  there are separate rooms with different music  the white room had a great vibe to it with folks getting down to the beats,2
door staff girl was the rudest person even the group in front of us was complaining about her as well we considered leaving at this point  but decided to try out the place very pretentious vibe will definitely not be going back,0
great club diverse crowd including age mature place where you dont have to worry about a shooting or hood crowd very sexy and sophisticated place free vodka drinks call early and put your name on the guest list to avoid lines if you can spare a few hundred between friends get a table its so worth it,4
went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu  the order counter seemed confusing to me too got a turkey sandwich  but think they used miracle whip not mayo  not a fan though,2
great food selection and excellent service  if youre vip you dont have to wait  high quality and pierre jout champagne,3
what a disappointment food overcooked certainly not worth the 85 much better places,1
nice place to visit to remind you how good the real thing was  best to go on the weekends as thats when the schweinshaxe is served,2
if you like this sort of thing go for it but anyone with kids who know the difference between kosher hotdogs and crap should avoid the childrens menu hot dog so disappointed at the lack of quality two bites and it went right into the trash but the onion soup was edible,0
this place is dece,2
expensive ok i dont know a real brat if it fell and hit me on the head but 15 for three brats some sauerkraut and mash great atmosphere beer looked awesome but im not spending 30 with tip for a beer and german hot dogs,1
im not quite sure how to rate this  in germany this food would be 2 star food at best  add on another star for the live music  if youve never been to the real one this is 4 or 5 stars,2
im not one for the heavy tourist spots so im prejudice against hofbrauhaus  that being said the sausage is ok  the beer is good  its just too kitchy and overblown for me  theres much better german food in vegas if youre looking,1
went last nite  very noisy not a romantic date nite place for sure  fun loud atmosphere lots of spankings lots of alcohol  the food just sosonprobably an ok place for a drunken party with friends not the place for a nice meal,1
good atmosphere good food,3
this place is a blast   like being in munich all yearwe celebrate alot of occasions here and always fungood food,4
this place is rowdy and awesome,3
great german food in an exact replica of the original hofbrauhaus in munich germany,3
fun and a good time but not much food for your money and its expensive i would go back there though maybe a once a year trip here not a regular location staff were great polite and fast,2
fun  like many things in vegas this copy of the munich hoffbrau haus has all of the form and none of the substance  if youre looking for an authentic experience this only partly fits that bill  that said the place is blast and ive always had a good time,3
food was boring and the quality of hometown buffet the price was ridiculously expensive i will never come to this restaurant again,1
the service was ridiculous took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria  after the food was finally brought out it was cold and didnt taste like eatable  i would never go back,0
unless youre a soccer futbol hooligan do not go here during world cup soccer   holy crap at 5pm there were so many drunk doucheburgers and i like to party yo i actually had to leave fearing id end up in a fight and in a lv jail,0
better than a buffet but not great portions were appropriate small and too salty wish i would have skipped the wine,2
the location of il fornaio is greatnice to be able to sit out and watch people in the casino  the service was also really greatnnhowever although the food was good i struggle to give more than 3 stars because i thought the price tag was really high for what we ordered,2
08012013nwe were there for happy hour the carpaccio was awesome the pizza fresh great cocktails exceptional service nice job,3
server very disconnected from doing his job serving i ordered the seafood mixed grill great flavor yet tiny portion for 30 all other flavors rocked,2
this place serves the best burger i have ever had its a hip joint with a great menu and amazing quality food no weaknessesnngo for the delux burger with sweet taters and extra helpings of aioli,4
the food is ok  i like the ambianceits a little expensive,1
turkey burger best anywhere ive been going here for years whenever i am in the area i have to eat there the 2 go take out service is really good but for some reason the wait staff not so much still hands down one of my fave places to go for a burger and fries this is not in n out mmmm,3
yeah use to be awesome but maybe not i dont really remember i think i just always really loved the super strong martinisnnnotherwise overrated completely but recently i did come to learn that the hot dog here is better than roosevelt which is saying a lot,1
went back and had the chinese chicken salad which was awesome virtually identical to the one at houstons but thats ok i love it anyway  our server was great  my friend had the bisque daily  and loved it and we shared jam fries  great experience even better than my previous one,4
im not a big fan of their burgers but i was a fan of a few other things so will give them another shot the service was outstanding the fries are tasty  come in a cute shopping cart i like the ambiance  the pear ale prices are a little high for what you get,2
a good burger and the best regular and sweet potato fries in phx however you need to provide good service  the service is not as good as either indulge zinburger or the grind and the seating is extremely cramped at peak periods  the food is very consistent parking can be a bit difficult,2
interior lighting has been brightened thus losing the coolhip and dim feel that i craved so much from delux liquor menu is way out dated staff made no effort to compensate prices have gone up service is consistently inconsistent theres a ton of places where you can get an 8 cocktail and 10 burger,2
this place is amazing every item we have gotten here has been awesome including the veggie panini,4
the service was a bit slow but the food made up for it the sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful we also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal i would definitely come back,2
this such a unique place and so is the food oh and by the way it is fantastic,3
amazing no need to bore you with the details look at the youtube vid for the food network that will tell you all you need to know,4
the jerk chicken fried rice was incredible and the red jade chicken was delicious and the perfect heat  however if you are trying to eat healthy this isnt the place for you,3
i dont get why this place is so overrated  i even came here twice to try and trick myself into liking it  the food is nasty really  mexican food cooked with the mystery asian meatis it chicken horse or catnnwho knows really  the food has a very bland taste dont waste your time,0
modern styles intertwined into a combo of cuisine between two cultures do not miss out on the bandido,3
the food here is very unique yummy fusion between mexican  chinese have to try it to believe it very laid back  i got to have a glass of wine with my dinner im def a fan,3
this place is an arizona treasure  i have been going there for 15 years now and its always consistently good  i recommend the 7q  9q with black beans and jerk fried rice  the included snicker doodle cookie makes it a complete meal,4
i liked that you can sample various items before ordering  loved the dish i ordered but now have to go back again to order the rest,3
this was a huge let down its in terrible need of a major cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were we will not be going here again,0
tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria uc davis has a better eating experience than this buffet limited selection and undercooked meat,1
this was the most disgusting buffet ive ever experienced im actually sick in my room from this place and i hardly are anything nothing was fresh everything probably came out of a microwave nterrible brunch,0
super place to eat dont waste your money on dennys or ihop great food staff and service open 247,3
bellagio and the wynn hotel buffets are two of the best in vegas  the quality and culinary touch is far better than the other vegas buffets  bellagios interior decor is surprisingly a bit cafeteria styled for one of the better hotels,4
i wouldnt come back here again especially for the price ive heard great reviews about this place but the only thing great about this buffet is the crabs the rest of the food was blah  j,1
this place makes a las vegas trip completennwe had the dinner buffet and it exceeded our expectations they have a wide selection of food as well as world class dessert chefs the seafood was all very fresh toonnthis is a must eat buffet if youre in vegas the price is worth it come hungry,4
overrated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost long lines are not worth the wait look elsewhere,2
great buffet i think i gained 5 lbs before the check came i just changed my mind and took away a star cuz i remember the steak or whatever meat they were serving was not that good,2
worth every penny  tons of selection,4
for the price i expected more a lot more  i went here for lunch about 5 years ago and was disapopinted by the lack of selection  there are many other better buffets to choose from like at paris or encorewynn  i would skip this one not worth itnnderek,1
very dirty placenthe bussers stroll around with big smelly carts with food leftovers between the tables to collect dirty dishes disgusting nnthe food was ok but not greatnthey had crab legs,2
food good but not as good as wicked spoon of wynns buffetnservice was not goodnrestrooms were terrible,1
disappointed nothing stood out the deserts were okay i honestly expected more,2
came here around 1230pm food was good but not great nfavorites were the pastas the meats were ok flank steak had minimal flavor mashed potatoes with gravy were average ribs required effort to try to get the meat off the bone desserts were ok overall would not come here again aria buffet was better,1
a buffet of average everything is okay nothing is bad but for bellagio youd expect a little more its not expensive relative to other buffets but its not cheap either they seem to have conceded to being average and they shouldnt have,1
had the breakfast buffet for 2  30 per person i would have liked drinks to be part of the package nnsome of the items were good but they dont make any customizations at all food is already prepreparednnthe ceviche and other seafood options were bad,1
not too bad but to be frank the buffet not meet my expectation or the buffet in some hotel in china is much better a little disappointed,2
take it from a real foodie this place is terrible if you have any food standards you wont spend your money here nnwicked spoon at cosmopolitan had much better quality and the presentation was even better nnovercooked seems to be the theme and overall just very subpar quality,1
why 3 stars its because ive been to bacchanal at ceasar palace and if to compare the two bacchanal is far greater than bellagio nnprice checknnbellagio  30nbacchanal  59nnjust add 20 more and you will not regret it  nngoodluck to buffet hunters nnhappy feasting,2
quality of food has gone down  we went for dinner and were disappointed  we have been here before so we looked forward to returning  we will be going to wynn instead,1
quality of the food was poor  lots of choices but just didnt think the food was worth the pricennthink a standalone place is a better choice  youll get better quallity food  eat less,1
i really liked the use of space and decorationsnni also like the coupon that they give nni did not like the mediocre food however it is a buffet and i did not expect too much from it,1
breakfast was very good still overpriced but goodnalot of variety,2
tipgo for a really late lunch 330pm or so and hang around for the dinner selections that come out about 430pm nnreally nice buffet great variety of selections nnthe crab legs were a bit salty nnvery friendlyhelpful staff,3
i would definitely check this off the list and not go back food was not enjoyable there were 7 of us and it was our last stop from our 24 hour vegas buffet pass none of us finished our food and hardly went back for seconds,1
i really liked it loved the cupcake variety food was fresh kept hot pleasant experience there will be lines no matter what time you go staff is polite and attentive went here on a groupon good wine and beer choices,3
typically buffet dried out food and over priced dont go without a discount of some kind go the dennys for breakfast instead,2
i wouldnt give it 2s if they wouldnt have crab legs and a decent waitress the foodskip itthe whole place has a hometown buffet energy to itjust sadeven the smell is akward  why would u put a restaurant in the basement area smh,1
i love this show  it was the most amazing show i have ever seennnthe only slight problem is that now i compare every show i see to this show and always end up thinking it wasnt as good as mystere  like nothing can come close,4
i am sorry but this show was just plain boooring the big fat stupid baby is just lame the host has too much time on the show and its not funny when its desperately trying to be funny ndont think im not a cirque fan because i am i loved ka and zumanity but mystere is just overated skip itnvery blah,0
ive seen two other cirque du soleil shows love and ka which i like better than mystere  the acrobatics are amazing but i wasnt the biggest fan of the comedic moments or the baby,3
so funny entertaining amazing and very intriguing i do not want to spoil the event with specifics however i believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer nni loved the show the performers are amazing  it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats,4
took my boyfriend for his bday  he looooooved it  score  it was his first time at cds and he cant wait to see others  suggestion know the storylinetheme beforehand it helps   worth the money so see it,4
this is the second cirque show i have seen and i love all of them they all seem to challenge your imagination and the performers are amazing,3
waste of money i went with 4 friends and all of us were falling asleep,0
loved mystere  this might actually be my favorite cirque show  there was so much action it was awesome  definitely recommended and not a bad seat in the house actually dont sit in the front row you want to be toward the middle so that you can see everything,4
great acrobatics but weird story  it is worth seeing once not sure i would go back unless i score a locals deal,2
brunch only until 1pm on sunday and noon on saturday  is it just my spoiled chicago self or does that seem a little early to stop serving brunch,2
good club but 1 major unexcuseable problem for menni have to wait in a line to go into the mens restrooms,1
tao was so lame  it was way too crowded no room to dance or simply walk past  i saw very few hot guys mostly a bunch of corny ass dudes  if you go get extremely faded beforehand so you dont notice how lame it is when you walk in  on the bright side if youre a hot girl youll get in free,1
it has an unique layout and although there is a lot of space it is crowded  i did find it easier to get a drink here versus other clubs on the same weekend  the crowd is a little older but not old  the night i was there i didnt see any issues with the dress code as others have commented,3
tao sucks next,0
the decor is not that creative  ok buddhas everywhere bathtubs w rose petals and girls in lingerie laying around boring nof course its super crowded why are there so many storieslevels  just open up the dance floor so my feet dont get stepped on,1
the bistro is pricey but good food  you have to want to go to enjoy the environmentnnthe nightclub was subpar  they played pop music and songs that are not fun to dance to unless youre drunk off your mind,1
tao is off the hook  bex hooked it up as always  great music great staff atmosphere was great  if you guys make it out to vegas go to taoyou nwont regret it  holla at my girl bex and she will hook it up with a great deal  bex once again you did itthanks for always hooking it up  until next time,4
they make you line up a mile long and wait till 1130 to let people in ndoormen are assholes,0
hello pretty girls bathing in bathtubsnnhello dude that came out from nowhere who talked to me weirdnnhello insanely packed crowdsnnhello expensive drinksnnhello las vegas,3
you ever been smacked in the bag by accident while playing sports how about a 100 times a night they need to work on some crowd control strats in that place music was ok asian gogo girls were hot drink prices were about avg for vegaswhen you could get one overall not a repeat venture in my book,1
the music sucks dj was really bad bunch of guys and not enough females dance floor too crowded,1
front staff annoyed me they have about 3 girls they look like theyre 16 or 17 have no customer service skills or communication skills i asked her a simple question about the open bar she had no fucking idea how to answer my question security guard total asshole not to mention they only accept cash,0
not bad but if ur a dude it doesnt matter what u spend bathroom line is ridiculous not worth the cover if ur a dude dont come,0
great resort  everything is laid out great with the exception of the 2 mile walk to the events center and conference halls  room service is great and there is a great selection of amazing restaurants,4
nice hotel excellent pool and relaxing spa,2
great rooms we had a living room and a bedroom with one and a half baths and even a tv in the master bath we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for my boyfriends birthday  a bit far to walk down the strip but the mandalay bay and the adjoining hotels have plenty to do,3
well this was the 24 hours to stay in this hotel nat first i get room floor 14 it was smelly and noisynthan they transfer me to floor 3 but it still smelly and noisynthan they transfer me to 20 floor that was only noisy nthan i left this poor place to other hotel and i feel great,0
best ravioli on the planet great fresh fish as well,4
kate and i recently held our wedding at the orpheum ceremony and all and it was fantastic the service the food the setting were all something special nnhats off to an excellent event coordinator a helpful bar staff and some very tasty scallops even if i was too busy to actually eat one,4
we couldnt get a table at emeril lagasses place so we ended up here it was in the same hotel the oysters on the half shell and tuna tataki and tartare was okay but pricey for my main dish i had the crispy duck breast pretty good it was a good thing i stay up the whole night after that dinner,2
we hosted a customer dinner event here last week  we had a group of 30 and our dinner was excellent  service and food was outstanding,3
holy sht the bacon cheese rolls amazballs good food and i liked the upscale atmosphere  nice place for a really expensive date night,3
mediocre pretentious and overpriced even by las vegas standards pedestrian presentation of decent steaks outrageous prices on the wine list go somewhere else,1
the sheer power and aura around this place for ten minutes helped finalize my decision to go to uwmadison i wanted to be there the setting is that goodnenough said,4
worst restaurant during our entire stay in vegas service and food was horrible our waiter gave us bad service youre better off going to mcdonalds very expensive,0
this place was pretty bad we got the nutella fruits du mer peanut butter  bananas and the mixed berry crepes the only one that was good was the peanut butter i think a lot had to do the poor quality of the ingredients would not go back,0
awesome crepesni would recommend the peanut,3
doesnt compare to the real deal but close enough for vegas i got the st louis for lunch the line was long and so was the wait time the portions are generous and fairly cheap around 10 per crepe but there is no overall pizzazz to the food more quantity over quality,2
avoid the seafood crepe nnbut everything else was yummy my favorite was the prosciutto and cheese crepe it was the perfect amount of saltiness and chessyness nni think youd fare better if you stick with the dessert crepes,2
i love this place we are staying at paris and have gotten crepes for breakfast every day my favorite is the bananas foster so incredibly delicious some other reviewers have mentioned flimsy utensils and paper plates but who cares really the crepes are the best,4
theres nothing quite like dancing on the deck 52 stories above the strip with the summer wind blowing your hair around it makes anyone feel like a hip hop video vixen yes boys even you,3
wasnt impressed by this show and even slept through part of it i saw another cirque du soleil show at suffolk downs a few years back that was much more entertaining i have to give the performers credit though the acrobatics and diving were pretty cool,1
the best show ive ever seen  great for all ages and worth every expensive penny  its eyepopping eyecatching eyecandy  and if youve never been to a cirque show its not all about clowns  the show is a visual masterpiece  go go go,4
amazing visual feast  well worth the price  just see it,4
damn this show is greatnyes the tickets are expensive but well worth the priceneverything is spectacular about the show i think every seat in the theater is a good seatnacrobatics and stunning visuals complete this show,4
definitely worth watching the girlfriend took me to see this and i was very pleased the transitioning from land to water was amazing dont waste your time on ny cirque du soleil showsstick with vegas wow,4
this is my third cirque showmystere and zarkana this was by far the best seriously air acrobats plus diving absolutely amazing very expensive but definitely worth the price  great vegas show,4
i have to say this is the worst 150 we spent in our entire life the show may be good in early 2000s but cant make me excited in 2013 any circus show on asian tv programs may be better than this sorry i just dont get it,0
fascinating jaw dropping,4
im going to be honest i had no flipping idea what was going onnnbut it looked cool as hell i say its an assault on your senses prob wouldnt pay to watch it again though,3
i feel asleep it wasnt that good some of t he stunts were cool but other than that it was okay,2
you can never go wrong with watching ka  the stage is a true masterpiece since it moves  the best seats are in the back section or else your neck might hurt from looking up if your in the front section  spectacular show  a must see,4
wow wow nfantastic showyou ask yourself all the time howd they do thatnreally enjoyed itntipdont see too far forwarda lot of action is up highgo for the middle,4
definitely loved ka  visually stunning and beautiful  this was my second cirque du soleil  definitely worth the   youll never see anything else like it nnbut as much as i loved ka i still loved o so much more because of the water  sorrynnboth are awesome,3
well this is truly a yawner  the show does have some great acrobats but the story is hard to follow  the moving stage gets old quickly  totally not worth the high ticket price  i was disappointed,0
not amused its an okay show but actually i was quite bored ive seen other cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with zumanity,1
i hated it  i felt the baton throwing and staged fighting was very boring,0
came here for the catfish sloppy joe recommended by oprah it was good but not mind blowing as oprah has exaggerated the clam chowder was good enough for seconds,2
the price is pretty standard for las vegas but i have to say they have great seafood options  and importantly theyre all naturalorganic caughtgrown etc  they have great fresh oysters from multiple locations and i actually had the best sushi ive ever had here,4
great  food but watch out for the specials with outrageous prices staff is apparently schooled to push the specials and avoid mentioning the super high prices deceptive practices like this ruin the experience,1
napkins shed little white flakes all over your clothes the lobster and and soups are great but the crab was bitter,1
the food was fresh and tasted great  however for almost 50 i received a piece of fish less than 3 ounces  the dish had no side literally nothing else on the plate excpet garnish  we skipped desert and got a yogurt next door for 6  dont waste your time here,1
tried this place for lunch good stuff authentic no one spoke english but tacos were not as good as los gemelos or taqueria el jalapeno  the baked items looked awesome wish i still had the metabolism of my younger self,2
its worth a look just to see the view from the terrace and the overthetop decor  id like to come here wearing a members only jacket just to bask in the irony,1
if it is supposed to be locals night on monday dont ask me for cover its an alright lounge but i am not paying cover for the right to purchase over priced drinks i left they can keep their liquor on the shelvesnni have been there before its a nice view but not worth the hassle,1
great clublounge excellent service and bottle service is a must the view in the patio is also wonderful special thanks to dimitri and kristina s for their excellenct customer service and friendliness,4
good night view  service was good  best place for romantics date birthday  when u visit vegas from other state you should try here,4
we got in for free from social house upstairs but left pretty quickly  the club is rather small and when we were there it was pretty empty  i certainly wouldnt pay to come in here,1
just called no longer open to locals unless you buy a cabana they dont like locals its just a lame slogan,0
this place always sends out shady advertising deals i am not sure what they mean by we love locals because we are locals and avoid this place like the plague,0
dennys quality food with las vegas quantity prices  pass,1
great brunchnot too pricey,2
terrible and not cheap the roast beef was bloody the chicken salad was bland the soda was watery the only ray of light to our meal was the onion rings are super yummy would not suggest this place to anyone with a million restaurants in vegas you can find better anywhere else,0
dont bother any breakfast dish will disappoint but the oj is great,0
did i go back in time nopenni must have gone to 35 or older night or there must have been some convention going on because i really felt out of place herennnuff said n ngood it was freennbad i feel so young all of a suddennnfinal maybe ill try again some other time,1
food is okay breakfast wasnt very good which is very disappointing when you are hung over but their salads and sandwiches were decent cant really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special,2
quality 247 food in vegas pit stop fill up drink up back at the stripnnif you want good portion sizes a meal thatll keep you full and want to pass up on mickey ds and dennys hit this place up,3
im a fan of cheesecake factory but i dont think this place is that good if you are a fan of cheesecake factory go there instead,1
everything about this restaurant is excellent pricequality servicewe always take our guest here never ate at the one in the palazzoweve never had a bad dish,4
i like this place for the food and reasonable prices  it is nice to take a couple steps away from the casino and have a good meal  the staff is always helpful and breakfast is really good  i recommend the protein breakfast,3
okay so my tastes have changed i still like this place but after my last visit its not as good as my previous visits  its still good just not as good as i remember it to be  i will try it again next week and let you know if it meets my standards again,2
the cheesecake factory owns this cafe  the food is always good and the prices are what you would expect  they are open 247  the wait staff is nice,4
i love grand lux i never had a item on the menu i didnt like came here late late night and they were out of bread the waitress brought us a order of fries to substitute try the cream of chicken soup youll thank me for it,4
been coming here for the past few years always a must everything is always delicious the staff is great we always come for the buffalo rollsballs and the cesar salad is our favorite great quality food and quick service,4
great food our service was excellent from pierre its quite reasonable for vegas but still high for the real world,4
went here for lunch and it was baaad the cornbread was edible and that was about it,1
what can i say its the house of blues if youve seen one youve seen them all mostly standing room unless you pay for bottle service or the balcony is open good sound i have no complaints,2
have eaten at the jade palace several times this past winter always excellent service and food it gets busy on the weekends so plan ahead,3
the food here is amazing i have tried more then half of it and its all great the staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home this is a great place to relax and have a blast,4
it is sad to see taiwan express go i enjoyed their food enormusly,2
ooo prettttyyynnthe dance floor leads to the outdoor area it gets kinda gross when the weather is hot because everyone is already sweating and the hot air does not make it betternnive noticed that the girls here are more,3
went here on friday night and was amazed by the beauty of this club you feel super vip getting your groove on here surrounded by all of its luxury all the people were cool hot women and handsome men didnt wait in line or pay to get in didnt drink either maybe the minus star for my sobriety,2
the waterfall behind the dj is the only amazing thing about this place its filled with 40 yr olds and they play top 40 songs mixed with random hiphop music makes me feel like im at an 18 club with creepers all over againeven the gogo dancers dont seem to enjoy it,1
this place was not good  definitely not the place to be scene  not a good looking crowd,1
memories memories memoriesnni have so much fond memories here  the club is swanky and is really good with treating the girls   my favorite thing playing on the pole  mental pictures no cameras please,4
came for a fraternity reunion a few years ago and for a friends bday not impressed this club is probably on its way to being played outlike tao pure etx,1
disliked the rooms not impressed,0
its already been said in every other review but the mattress factory is pretty amazing  they have installations that are extremely unique and orginal  you wont find art like this anywhere else in the city,3
very nice atmosphere for a date or with friends  if you are into wine this is a great spot,3
very nice atmosphere as far as the food the only i had so far was the shrimp bisque it was good not great but good but i will go back to try a few other things,1
love this place  ive only been here twice both for lunch and both times were excellent  great place to get a sandwich  hot or cold fresh products make this a nice lunch spot ill definitely be back,4
i went back to rancho de tia rosa on may 8 2008  its still ok but not bad for the area  ill stick to the original rosas out on universitynnthis will be the place for meeting my friends who live on that side of town,2
eh just ok  i wasnt wowed by the food and my horchata was very watery and too sweet and served in a leaking broken cup  in addition there was a long wait to be seated and once we were service was a bit spotty,1
the building is cool the food value is pretty good but food flavor has diminished a lot  the salsas were sweet why sweet and the meats were bland  bummer  better mexican food is pretty commonly available,1
ive been here 3 times with the inlaws and it really is not very good not bad mind you but not what i want from mexican food i would call this more mexicali food with a lot more cali than mexi good for those that dont like much spice or real mexican food there is always a wait on weekends,1
if you choose just one mexican restaurant in mesa choose this one  it ranks as one of the best in flavor authentic food and decor,4
ive been there twice mostly due to the ambiance after my last experience having to order from the to go area due to a fire in the main kitchen i have decided to never go back taco bell would have been better,0
great sushi and service  the 5th star just being held back because of the high prices  incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online,3
good cold beer good chips  salsa the steak pyramid was excellent our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide definitely recommended,3
delicious enchiladas divorciadas and pineapple mojitos,4
just ate there last night with my girlfriend and it was awesome  the braised short rib flakes off as you push down with your fork the cocktails are great and even their take on a fish taco has its own novel nuances,4
phenomenal service fresh salad and tasty soups made from scratch i will definitely be back they make it so easy to eat healthy,4
i have enjoyed numerous experiences at shady grove however when i went there recently it resulted in a horrible stomachache i am not sure which of the dishes i got which were the thai shrimp tacos summer salad and the goat pizza i will not be going back anytime soon,1
you can never go wrong with maggianos rigitoni d is the best i was surprised however this one wasnt crowded on a sunday evening the food was wonderful the waiter did make us feel a bit rushed when ordering but accommodated our children very well,3
great food  great service nice atmosphere,4
i like to stop in here now and again since its so close to home good service and a really fun selection of gelato shares the building with coffee shop hava java next door nice private outdoor shaded seating as well good overall but three stars for an previous issue with some spoiled gelato,2
famous daves is a typical corporate barbecue place  heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats on the plus side the bar is nice and well stocked but i wouldnt suggest going for the food,1
good mexican food but its expensive at least i thought so i went there for lunch and had the lunch special 10 and a coconut margarita 10 which equaled 22 for lunch the drinks were also slow to come out so if youre a tourist i think its okay but for a local its pricey,2
just get the coconut margarita nntaco bell is better in respect to the food and service quality,2
not worth a penny of your money  the food is just awful  its equivalent to chevys  so you think chevys is great food youll love this place  if you are looking for decent mexican food however steer clear,0
quite possibly the worst texmex meal ever served  i had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in february 2010  what a disaster  it was so bad that everyone at the table commented on how bad the food was  save for the chips and salsa complete disaster,0
the margarita brunch on sunday is definitely a great value  1699 gets you delicious buffet offerings omelet station beautiful desserts and house margaritas free flowing  this was my birthday choice and nothing i mean nothing says happy birthday like margaritas for breakfast,3
i and my 4 friends were not impressed with this place  the pizza isnt what we feel is great pizza  go to la grande orange pizzaria bianco or cafepino,1
since theres over 200 reviews before mine ill keep it shortnncibo is a cool place with hip customers and an emphasis on quality  the bruschetta appetizer is a winner  see pic try to save room for the crepe desserts,4
very good pizza it had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers we would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon food came out fast and the place was clean love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan phoenix definitely try it out,3
i love their burrata cheese it is to die for and of course their pizzas are amazing nice patio seating is a plus and its not too hard to find good parking in the area,4
i like cibo better than bianco as a restaurant but chriss pie is still better by a nose cibo has bad parking nice ambience spotty service good menu fresh high quality ingredients and good value translates to hit the off hours get a pie order the antipasto and have a nutella desert,3
yummy for me tummy,3
very nice ambiance however i was not crazy about the service that was provided nnour server was really uninterested to be there didnt seem like she cared at all she has handed us two different manus and soft drinks were priced diferantley on both,2
this place used to be better but unfortunately its going down hill the food is bland the chicken in their salads especially i used to like it but now i have no reason to go back,2
enjoyed my veggie burger with fries service sucked the last 2 times we had to flag down a waitress to get our refills next time well do take out to avoid tipping poor service,1
ive visited fez and few times and plan to put it on regular rotation now that ive moved back to phx  tasty and inventive food good service really nice atmosphere,3
great lunch specials and service was great will be back,4
great sunday brunch excellent breakfast excellent dinner trendy yet quality food i like this place,3
after the manager read my review he contact me and apologized i have yet to return to the place but the manager assured me my experience will be different since then the server that served me was terminated looking forward to going again,3
happy is great good food drink specials and the staff are nice,4
awesome great food amazing sangria and the staff is very kind would highly recommend this place,4
one of our downtown phoenix staples i love the strawberry blueberry cashew salad and the margaritas annnd the spicy harissa fries aaaand the hummus you really cant go wrong no matter what you order,4
if you like smokefilled shitholes without working electrical outlets and staff who wait on you at their convenience then the plaza is the hotel for younnnever again  i wouldnt return if they paid me,0
quick reviewnnwe ate at the sushi place inside and it was delicious my boyfriend loves it here just because they offer crapless craps i can safely say that we will probably stop by on our next trip,2
5 friends playing blackjack at one table dealer did not know rules of game she was dealing 1 12 pay on bj she insisted and payed as 1 on bj pit boss eventually noticed and corrected dealer then unable to remember 3 bj at table realy wtf its a pit dont go,0
service is excellent food was soso music is also good drinks were tasty sit upstairs where the band is,2
im going to give this place 5 stars only because i feel bad i kinda threw up on their floor nnim really sorry jimmy i was really trashed,4
over priced over rated,0
this was the first place open serving food that was close by our hotel once we got settled in we split an order of nachos which were huge the late night crowd was there and they had the lights turned down and the music blaring not the atmosphere i expected,1
its a party on the inside very cool decor and volcano shownnbetter burgers than the burger joint in the same locationnnaverage food but worth the price,2
the food is below average for the strip the only reason to goto this place is to drink a cold one and watch all the hot chicks parade up and down the strip having said that i love this place,2
place is always happening and the food is great  it can get real crowded and the wait can be long to get a seat so i f there is room in the bar then go ahead if not wait its worth it,4
loved it ordered my virgin daiquiri in a miniblender im pregnant and was a happy girl bartender was very friendly and made sure that no one took my seat since i was pregnant and couldnt stand long will definitley go back,3
seating at late evening was poorly done as no hastiest was there to seat you  we were told sit where you want  after 10 min the waiter for that area said he was getting off and we needed to move  pricy for what you get will look elsewhere next time im in town,1
stopped by the outdoor bar so the wife could get a foofoo drink while we were walking down the street while i dont necessarily mind paying 10 for a drink in a small plastic cup it better have some booze in it at that price this one according to my wife did not pass mustard in that department,1
awesome time with the family i mean the tequilla didnt hurt but it was good food good music and live entertainment  mt three boys loved the dancing betty in a swimsuit  kinda pricey though,3
i think this would have been a five star if wed have had the nachos and a cheeseburger as it was we shared a club and the teriyaki chicken it was decentnnbut lets face itwe came for the ambiance the music and the boozeand margaritaville did not disappoint i say drink first  eat after,3
the nachos were huge they were pretty good the margaritas are really good and have a nice kick,2
great steak fajitas i was super hungry after a night of cocktails  crapsi like the liveband and the decor well def be back next time,3
came here one night with my hubby we drank margaritas the night started out with people singing karaoke but once people stopped going up the karaoke host rocked it it was a lot of fun,3
went there with a party of 9 and they refused to seat us together service was awefull and food took over an hour they were not busy   some people liked the food some didnt my spaghetti carbonale was very dry not good at all  ndefinitely dont recommend this place  they just didnt seem to care,1
i hate clubbing and hate people who refer to themselves as clubbers this place is about as much fun as church on sunday and has just as many fake people as church as well stay away unless you want to be surrounded by douche bags,0
i visited this place today for the first time in 15 years  i have to say  they still have all of those amazing recipes and flavors  now that im back in town it will certainly be a restaurant that i visit frequently  seriously tasty food,4
sticky tables loud mediocre food for the price decent saki selection bumped it to 2 stars  look for better,1
i stopped in here with the owners girlfriend after she cut my hair she kindly treated me to anything i wanted to eat and drink wooo hoo i ordered a grey goose and cranberry and a las vegas roll my all time favorite sushi even if it is fried both were delicious thank you,3
hair in our sushi all servers with their long hair down not fresh not good wont be back,0
came here late night for cocktails and a bite loved the dumplings  beef skewers were good but kinda marbled watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol overall a great experience,3
no other place like itnnnleave your girlfriendswives at home,4
great variety of machines from many eras and lots of fun,4
best pinball arcade in the usa,4
what a fun trip down memory lane i loved seeing some of the old pinball machines and a tron video game holy crap and letting my kids experience such a large chunk of my childhood everyone should go here and visit at least once,3
always love bringing folks here for the first time awesome selection of games it seems they are going to outgrow this spot tonight had the most machines ive seen there  i enjoy the older 50s and 60s games as well as the new nclean fun date night  any night highly recommend,4
had a few rolls miso soup and sake the food was pretty good but the service was non existent nnno one asked if we wanted more hot tea or cold sake when i asked for fresh wasabe the sushi chef said it too expensive for our clients nnwell go to naka sushi next time,2
my husband and i stopped  at sugar  ice one morning as we were waiting for shops to start opening at 10am  the food and drink were a little pricey but good  i had a delicious iced latte and we sat out on the patio watching the waterfall  it was relaxing and a great way start off the morning,3
there was a chunk of chocolate the size of a thumb in my ice cream and i dont think it was a mistakennway to go you magnificent ice creamiers,2
this is the best sanctuary on the strip they have incredible shakes and desserts and the patio is perfect for relaxing and watching the waterfall,4
had his croissant at bellagio a few years ago and never forgot how good it tasted  ngot to relive that memory this weekend  it was every bit as good as i remembered itnnregular croissant  dub expressonnbest ever,4
best best best been there a few times and its always the best ive ever had,4
the food and pastries here were fantastic the service was very friendly their pricing is extremely high and not locals friendly,2
croissant wasnt that good i like bouchon bakery croissant better the red velvet taste like chocolate but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing nmy fave is the fruit tart,2
i came for sunday brunch  nothing stood out  food was for the most part overcooked and not memorable  dessert section is ok  definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in vegas  will not be coming back,1
best buffet in vegas hands downnnits like eating at a gourmet restaurant and ordering well everythingnnside tip do not eat wynn buffet an hour before you go clubbing your dress may not fit this has happened to me before,4
price range from 20 for breakfast 30 for lunch 40 for dinner thats just me rounding it up  went there for dinner food wasnt anything different from any other buffet but the customer service was great from the whole staff i was impressed by the service more than the food,2
although we typically do not like buffets we tried this thinking that since it is at the wynn it would be good  the only thing that was half way decent was the pastries  everything else was typical dry cold and crappy buffet food,0
the best buffet on the strip pricey but you pay for what you get and the food is top shelf chefs are top shelf waite staff outstanding  you expect the best from this place this was a very enjoyable experience,3
guys must wear shirts with sleeves even when the weather is ridiculously hot in vegas  pricy but the food and interior make up for it  lots and different choices of things to be put on the your plate their desserts are actually good compared to other buffets their corn on the cob is super delicious,3
to be honest i was disappointed maybe because i have high expectation since the lines are so long and waiting time is miserable nnthe environment is nice but the choices are too limited some food are really saltynnwill not eat again next time,2
we went for saturday brunch the food was good  prime rib dim sum lots of fruits and veggies and a make your own ice cream sandwich station its not a five star because of the long wait time 35 min at 2 pm lots of empty tables and the price i didnt feel the food was worth the money,3
went to eat at 1230pm on friday after thanks giving wait time was 4045 mins which is okay they were charging 50 bucks per person as they were starting dinner at 1pm are you kidding me who eats dinner at 1pm ridiculous never going back there,0
time end of june sunday brunch nsmoked bacon 5 stars was one of the best ive hadnporridge 5 stars simple and yumnneverything else was close to at par i wont be coming back,2
we had complimentary passes to the buffet from our stay at encore  we decided to check this place out for brunch  the food is pretty much on par for any sort of buffet in las vegas  the one item that was missing was crab legs  i will most likely not be back as i am not a big fan of buffets,2
i may know how magnets work butntex tubbs quesonnshit is magical,2
i like the reasonably priced reliable and tasty black bean burrito the wilmar with its fresh avocado inside  too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush better as take out,2
oh now theyve done it added live music on select weekends i didnt think it could get any better but it did,4
i had a very good experience at fix i had the ribeye steak and fries which was excellent the atmosphere was upbeat and the staff was attentive and friendly,3
didnt get a chance to eat just had a couple drinks l really cool laid back feel i think the whole design and the lighting service was really good will come back soon to check out the food,4
great atmosphere i love to sit at the bar and order nachos or enchiladas and hang out with my husband the service and food are good,3
went for dim sum last summer after graduation medicore it was not that good at all,2
bad service ok food overpriced prices but hey its vegas i like the decor but a 20 minute meal took an hour because the waitstaff was so inattentive,1
wow everything we ordered was so fresh and awesome we wil return here again we ate here before seeing le reve as the show was wonderful so was  red 8nnservice was so exceptional it is one of the best asian we have eaten in las vegas,4
service was nice but the foodmy second time here after 3yearsdont recall the first time if i liked it  but my husband wanted chinesereally sorry to say that we felt even panda express was better than here,1
excellent food and service  only mistake chef made was there was a piece of plastic paper slipped into the coffe from the kitchen  manager apologized and gave us free dessert however it was pretty dangerous that we almost drank in that plastic paper,2
my friend and i tried two different tasting menu there generally it was good but just felt a little bit over priced i paid 180 for mu meal in all including a cup of rose and tip tax if you never tried any modern mixture of french and japanese cuisine i would recommend it,3
this is my first sushi experience in arizona and it was good but nothing spectacular the food is good the service is decent and they wouldve gotten four stars except the music that plays is so annoying that it ruins the atmosphere of the place ambience is pleasing to the eye but horrible on the ears,2
i have been here many many times and it never gets old the hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want  its a pretty small place which i love its very ambient and relatively romanticnnnever had a problem with service or waiting either,4
what a shame the groupon was the only reason i give it a star to begin with  the meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with nnthere was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor,0
good food great service but im still hungry after 60ni would go back but not when im really hungry,2
super fun  great people watching  very nice and attentive staff  drinks were good looked like the food was too    like i mentioned amazing people watching here  nnits definitely an adult pool no kids at all,3
fabulous sunday brunch the staff was friendly and attentive although our server disappeared for long periods of time  great experience and i would definitely go back request to sit inside on particularly hot days,4
wow what a quiet hidden gem in the middle of a loud casino food service outdoor patio all a amazing place for lunch on the patio overlooking golf course and waterfall,4
when i got to this place i was super stoked the ambiance was amazing service for sure is excellent food  outback is better not worth 100 buckaroos  per plate  hey but i heard brunch is really good here ill try it sometime,2
meh pretty boring in my opinion i cant think of any particular segments were i thought it was funnycool nnthe last 10minutes was entertaining though or maybe i was just excited for the show to finally be over i dont know nndont recommend at all,0
missed the lunch special by a few minutes which in las vegas means it is happy hour great waitress well versed in the menu so good  had spicy shrimp edamame and a few other things everyone was happy and its cheap i dont mean cheap by comparison  i mean cheap,3
best happy hour 37 monsat and get the 22oz kirin and small sake for 775 salmon carpaccio was nice and vegas roll cant go wrong with the tuna tataki and rainbow roll for 775 each during hh,4
i wasnt that impressed with this restaurant when we are there a month ago food was mediocre and tables were dirty i just read that they were featured in dirty dining this week for for 38 demerits nhttpwwwjrncomktnvnewsdirtydiningdirtydiningasianbuffetandrasushi269299381htmllcsmart,0
overpriced sushi thats average drinks are decent but also pricey,1
this is not a japanese restaurant we did the 20 buck allyoucaneat sushi thing which was a tragic decision the sushi rice is terrible but the crab roll appetizer was really good my theory is that if you stick to chinese food youll be okaynnour waiter was french and snooty i thought he was funny,0
i came here with my friend for his early birthday dinner  for 20 all you can eat sushi ive had better  there werent even fillings in the sushi so it was basically all you can eat rice i felt bad for my friend since i chose this place but thats a note to myself in the future,1
the service is slow food is expensive you wont be satisfiednnthe place was empty yet it took nearly 30 minutes to get food i was still hungry but ate my mediocre food didnt want to wait another 30 minutes and spend 20 to get more expensive food so i left a good place to stay away from,1
stoles it i got the coconut shrimp which was amazing the shrimp is huge and i had the lobster shrimp and crab sandwich which was awesome however the fries that went with it were average,3
very nice and new hotel  it is a bit away from the strip so either bring a good pair of walking shoes or extra money for cab fare however being a little distance from the strip can be a good thing because its quiet  for the price i would stay there again,2
always have had good experiences at prime  they have high quality meats and good service,3
standard typical hotel cafe fare nothing to write home about really caution the juice is 550glass youve been warned,2
like an ihop or dennys inside monte carlo but not as good not expensive but we should of went to the food court that was around the corner better price and probably more appetizing,1
friday happy hour menunsteak and cheese   6 decentnneopolitan milkshake  4 decentngyro  6 no more next timenpanini  6 okaynnservice is slow despite it being almost emptynnoverall its okay if you are starving hungover drunk or didnt think of other options,1
ive been here for hiphop nights and electronic nights it is assholes to elbows on hh nights getting from one side to the bathroom can be a horrible challengenndoor is behind dj so when you come in you are kinda right there in the businessnnupgraded speakers as of last wednesday,2
the bartender was rude and if i wasnt with my family i would have thrown my drink in his facenactually i wanted to do a lot more but i figured a true review would hurt them most  dont go,0
first time visit great view of strip at table wonderful atmosphere great food good prices great service,4
nice place for a lunch if youre in fashion show and dont want standard foodcourt food,2
i dont see what the big deal is  everyone told me that this is the best buffett  i dont think i havent been to any others but i dint think that this buffett is the best the breakfast is way better than dinner and the basically have the same stuff for breakfast as dinner too lol,2
i would give this place 35 star rating if i could above average quality for buffet lots of choices and even they had a lot of choices of asian food and dessert not worth the 15 hours waiting though imo,2
one star for the gelato the rest of the food was not good and the rio hotel is in bad shape it was recommended by worldmark and i am unsure why we went on 76 for breakfast and there was no line at all no wonder,0
they have a good selection servers are friendly food is great except the limited selection for desserts the last time i went there the servers at the dessert section were chitchatting they know people were waiting but acted like they didnt noticed,3
i ordered the steak omeletwhen my order arrived it had no steakthen i had the waitress take it backshe gave me a new order that had steak on itbut then the egg wasnt cooked all the wayand i mean it was almost raw i sent it back for the third time and finally got the right order,0
everytime i go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher im pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the ihop chain,0
brunch for two on a sundaynnall on the positivegreat atmosphere service was prompt and polite pressed coffee was good the breakfast was above averagechelseas hotcakes  bacon the chilaquiles were outstanding   nnwe will be back when in the phx area,4
delish i really liked this chelseas we ate on the patio and it was beautiful the food was really good i had the fillet tacos and they were perfect the key lime pie was the best ive ever had and the service was great,3
rude staff way over prized spent 60 on two drinks and two servings,1
some tasty food here we come here a lot and just love the food the deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever the best thing here is the hamburgers they use kobe beef the best kind you kind eat and its high quality and fresh also juicy yum  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well,4
use to come here all the time what happened very rude staff sat inside dust all over every where lamps etc food does not carry the same quality sad to experience this never coming back,0
went herewith my friends and had the lunch buffet very limited choices only chicken and vegetarian naan was crispynot much more to say,1
my friends and i were walking down the strip really hungry and we had no idea what to get until we saw tamba  the restaurant is kind of hidden in a shopping center  but im glad we found it great service and great food i got the buttered chicken with rice and garlic pita bread soo good,4
wait youre shitting me right  35mins wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs  no way,0
way overrated bathroom in the kitchen gross  know what youre eating  how much was the oj again,0
got 3 dishes because me and the boyfriend are greedy like that  eggs with salami was truly outstanding creative and delicious eggs and pork chop were ok chop flavor was good but a bit over cooked waffle was good nothing special hash browns and home fries both pretty good not great good coffee,3
love their cheeseburger can tell its real meat no 90 fillers hotcakes real maple syrup and best bacon ever do expect about 1 to 1hr12 wait but totally worth it,4
long wait 40 minutes on a friday morning guess its due to limited seating capacity but the five spot and home fries were delicious,3
finally got something ive never had at this place good serviceobviously a phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once but new location loses some of the old charm  limited menu but pretty goodexpect a long line,3
we have friends who rave about mu shu we like it but not enough to make it regular and we live just a few blocks away pricevalue is measured in pounds friendly service still its cafeteria quality,2
came in at lunchtime first thing very noisy margarita was good if you want tacos go to filobertos  enjoyed the carne asada lunch bit was lacking that certain something overall good service food was good but not fantastic,2
i love sb  i eat there at least once a week and find that the menu has a good variety  i like the daily menu with different seafood items  jessica is the best,4
rosies is mine and my sisters go to beer place it is conveniently close and just very cozy i always get the magners cider which is so damn delicious and wenesdays live performer is always so delightful to listen to,3
great authentic irish pub not a chain just a real irish pub great food music and people  this is a sure thing to bring out of town guests family and to celebrate your life great memories here for sure,4
i had the pastrami reuben it was super delicious the nachos are definitely a must have as well  it has a great atmosphere and the service was perfect cant wait to go again,3
overpricednni spent about 300 on bra underwear garter and stockingsnnif you have boobs bigger than a c dont expect to find your size,2
worst ted baker shopping experience ever theres a sales guy with weird hair he is super rude,0
this show is more serious than mystere the acrobats in le rev though was phenomenal the whole time we had our jaws touching the ground the set up of the show was great audiences are able to view the performers from anywhere they sit this is a show i will definitely recommend,3
seems to want to be o but it did have good effects music and talented artists however the actual story is lacking coherency and things arent as stemless as a cirque show,2
sat in the front row got wet and watched a pretty cool show its all mostly in water which felt kinda repetitive but still kept me interested throughout worth the watch but definately not for the money seen better for less,2
this performance was on par i think to  michael jacksons cirque show and much more artsy i like the small venue and the greek theatre layout as well,2
i agree with generally everyonennhummus goodnndrink prices and ingredients confusingnnwaitresses awfulnnpotential therennmusic awesome,2
great place to grab a few beers with the friends awesome energy love going there,3
new carlys no tuna menu change  carlys removed the tuna sorry but as that was my fav sandwich i wont be back bummer less options other than chicken  beef new menu letdown boo dislike,0
excellent food excellent service and great ambience will definitely come back on my next trip to arizona,4
we enjoyed this buffet it was a little too pricey considering the bellagio which is awesome is only a few dollars more but there was quite a variety of items and staff were pleasant not sure if i would return with all the other options on the strip,2
its a vegas buffet  not the top buffet around wicked spoon not the worst any station casino but pretty much smack dab in the middle  go around 230pm save a few bucks by paying lunch prices then after 300pm the dinner comes out including the crab legs,2
yes pleasennlove in  out nn2 animal style is like sex,4
re  dinnernnthis place is as consistent as any other innout with less of a wait  its a little off the strip so if you do not have a vehicle if visiting vegas it would make it tough to eat here  if theres such thing as quality fast food this is it  cheers,3
i love lisas bowl of balls  it is a very yummy and satisfying dish  i go to lisa gs just for her meatballs when im craving meat  i highly recommend this dish,3
its a lounge they serve alcohol they play music simplennnothing to compliment it on and nothing to complain about averagenngreat for older people i guess,2
fresh shrimp crab legs to enjoy prime ribs  leg of lamb on carving table many different other dishes a lot of desserts including crepes made to order weekday price is more worth it,3
by far the best breakfast buffet in vegas theyve got it allnnbenedict crepes eggs all meats wonderful desserts i would not suggest this buffet at dinner time but for lunch you can not miss it,4
i had higher expectations for this buffet  i will say that it was just ok  the crepes for breakfast were pretty good and they did ok for dinner  but its not the best in vegas  some dishes were hit or miss,2
not a lot of selection the food sucks,1
one of the better buffets in the buffet of buffets 24 hour deal in vegasni dont mind coming here but its not the most amazing place evernn a huge variety of foods and they were all quite yummyn freshly made crepes mmmm pn get the prime ribbbbnn 17 gratuity for 8 people,2
always a solid buffet  maybe not as large a selection as some of the others like the carnival world but everythign they put out is always great and it doesnt matter what meal you are there for save room for a crepe theyre just plain awesome,3
crepes station is top notch seafood was okay  kind of worn down in the last 5 years a deep cleaning would be great for this whole seating area probibly backstage too,2
we came to vegas on a very small budget we got the buffet of buffets deal and ate at le village it was lovely the decor was beautiful and the food was outstanding we even decided to return for dinner very pleased with the entire experience,4
get ready to wait for an hour just to sit down and eat the service is horrible the buffet looks is half empty but for some reason it takes forever to be seated,0
we got there late at 9 am  such a long line but there were tons of tables so i dont understand  waited thirty minutes and left  it was 111113   ill use open table next time,0
w  k is my goto place for chinese  great chow at a cheap price  the sushi is very good and inexpensive  i love this place,3
complete assholes nuff said,0
the food was good but the waiter over sold the dish  it was good but the way the waiter talked about the food was over rated,2
love the stuffed chicken wings and the rice combo plate as well as the pho,4
great food great beer great service great atmosphere,3
good food great service fun atmosphere fabulous beer selection need i say more,3
great flavor in the kansas city beef ribs but unfortunately the inside was cold makes me wonder if they just reheat everything brisket was good and with the 34 different bbq sauces youll find a flavor that suits your tastes,2
pretty good bbq  pulled turkey was a little dry but the green been casserole and the mac and cheese redeemed it for 3 stars the ambiance is cool so i would still definitely come back live music outside is a huge plus,2
best collard greens ive ever had with bbq to match 3 pints of any beer on mondays super friendly wait staff im definitely coming back here next time im in the area,4
great food  especially the grilled meats  try the chicken bbq pork bbq or galbi  remember to grab some of the free soup its always yummy  the owners are very nice people and the food is consistently good,4
probably has the best ddukboki on campus its made in such a way that you still want to pay for it cause even though you can make your own version at home their version is that much better also they get the rice right every time its the simple things that add up,4
not that good not that bad  soso more or lessnnstopped by here for lunch the other day i had the bbq chicken lunch  overall a pretty bland taste but maybe that is just the style  if i ever end up here again i may try something else but i wont be going out of my way to do so,2
it was nice the cashier was chipper the food was just like the ll in oahu wish they would crank the ac a little more thoughnnrestroom was a little dirty,3
i wish we would have stayed here both nights we arrived and stayed here our first night in attempts to stay closer to the strip we went to the elara but both my hubby and i agree we wouldve preferred this place for a 2nd night its right next to the tram and easy access to the strip,3
decent business hotel and well off the stripquiet staff were helpful and the place was clean,2
didnt stay here but was here for an event in their lobby and it definitely had a weird vibe for vegas  that is there wasnt any gaming  this is probably a great hotel if you come to vegas for a trade show and are a boring person who doesnt enjoy all vegas has to offer,3
its ok food  nothing extraordinary  the pricing i thought was a bit off given the quality of foodservicennthe menu is pretty concise and tothepoint  very american palettefriendly,2
my husband and i enjoy eating at noodle asia  nnone of our favorites we like to order is their pan friend dumplings  they are huge  they are filled with pork and vegiesnntheir noodle soup the duck and bbq pork is delicious as well  ive tried mama woos spicy noodles soup too and it was great,4
im a fan of good chinese i must say the wonton soup was loaded with big fat wontons 8 of them and the pan fried noode dish with chicken was awesome i went twice worth every penny,3
the food was alright but definitely cost more than it should  we went for a quick lunch and the service was alright too but the food was not up to par with your typical vegas food  btw dont get the kim chee not good,2
really good chinese food  the duck and pork noodle soup is awesome  portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for chinese hotel strip food,3
pricy but food was not as good as before  we had this 40 year old lady serving us and she didnt do wellgave us the wrong check and went back to blame on the cashier when she was the one grabbing the wrong checki heard it allwont go back again,1
chive dumplings were ok fried rice was bland and too greasy beef stew was alright and the chicken ginger noodle soup was very bland and chicken was too dry,0
its cracker barrel it will be just like any other cracker barrel youve been too big country breakfasts down home cooking you know the drill its not fancy but its dependable,3
its ok i just expected better food was microwaved and flavorless,1
we were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed  the waiter was ok but i expect more from a high priced restaurant  my dish raviolini was pretty good but my husbands tasted like i could have thrown it together for my kids  overall big let down,1
food was soso service was soso location was noisy but then again its the paris hotel in vegasnnwould i recommend it if you cant get into another place yes otherwise its nothing special really,1
we just had our wedding reception at le cafe and it was an excellent experience  sal cavalcante was the manager on duty and he made sure that our party was well taken care of  the chef adam did an excellent job with the food and sals team with the service will definitely go back,4
we had the lunch menu and it was great i am sure i will be back next time in vegas,3
1398 prime rib in the middle of the strip  great deal when you consider a simple turkey sandwich could cost more than that across the street at the bellagio or caesars  nice menu quick service  not very large so i imagine there would be a wait at busy times  i was there on a monday night off season,2
service was great  this price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest  my favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet  would definitely come here again,3
great food great service nice ambience and reasonable prices for the strip so far this is the best chinese restaurant ive found on the strip in a resort,3
i like this place i thought the food was fresh and service was great  i dont think the price was really that bad if you compare it to other hotels restaurants  the place looked cool too,3
4 stars for being able to get a tasty and goodsized portion of spicy malaysian chicken fried rice late afternoon without leaving bellagio soaked up some of the days excess alcohol wonderfullynna star off for having to pay bellagio prices for the above,2
turns out eating here appropriately is a crap game food always ok to good service you need to bring your luck,1
go get cup o noodles nneverything is a rip off in vegas but this one is the biggest rip off ever price for a small size bowl of noodle soup ranges from 14 and up price really isnt a big issue if youre actually eating food that are satisfying to the taste buds but this place was blaaahhh,1
slimy noodles and lots of dim sum crowded noisy mediocre service very forgettable it was so bad we went to the chocolate place at bellagio afterward to recover,1
came here this past veterans day weekend  the woman needed her asian food fix  i dont know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good asian cuisine  had the duck a noodle dish and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish  just okay for all of it and ive definitely had better,1
not for anyone looking for authentic chinese food i would go for the location if staying in bellagio otherwise its overpriced and the poor quality does not deserve it,1
deelicious reasonably priced and excellent service  i would go back in a heartbeat and gladly recommend this restaurant,4
excellent service noodles were perfect however the flavor was nonexistent very nice staff and decent prices considering the location  i dont think i would come back again but i am glad that i tried it,2
convenient location pork barbecue tasty st louis ribs sauce tangy,3
excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in mesa the decor here is a little old fashioned  kinda feels like having breakfast in kansas,3
we have lived here for almost 5 years and we just found this place  we are always on the hunt for a great bfast place   i,3
great place i would give it 5 stars if it were larger and the lines smaller and if the greeterservers stringy black hair would have been tied up it was dragging in the food as she bent over to put the plates on the table  but i will be back,3
crab omelet more like imitation crab meat which is really just a mix of various extra fish parts processed and flavored like crab when will restaurants be honest about what they serve its just sad,1
much like the rest of the strip this place is ridiculously overpriced and the food isnt that good if youre hungry but dont feel like a sandwich entrees will run from 2535 go to a buffet and get your moneys worth of food if not in quantity at least itll have quality,1
scaled down version of rainforest cafe water show was lame food was less than averagenwish we could have sat at the barlooked fun but it was full would not go back just for the bar nonly pro was that we did not have any problems with the service and waiter was pleasant,1
the service of our waitress was very rude and not professional  sat for 20min never came back to take our order food didnt taste good it was too salty,1
bad food bad service bad drinks i guess we caught our server on an off night but the next day we ate here again after leaving the pool and the food was even worse than the night before,0
too bad we werent 21 because you need alcohol to make this place okay the appetizer did not have a volcano as described and the meat in it was dry the crab cake seemed old and left an oily taste in our mouths if we ever do come back here when we are in vegas it will be strictly to try their drinks,0
way to expensive for what you get glad i bought a groupon for this place the food is way to much for what you get the atmosphere was alright but nothing to write home to mom about,1
this explains my disappointmentif they are busy service quality  everything falls apartnnhttpwwwjrncomktnvnewsdirtydiningdirtydiningkahunaville278585471html,0
had the king crab legshard to give it anything but 5 stars but it was pricey  its a great restaurant but in a town of great restaurants its 4 stars,3
i just dont love it i think the average price of a pair of jeans is about 210 high perhapsnnalso the store has a pretty small selection  their website is much betternnhowever i do have to say the staff was really nice,2
its a win when you see your best friend get a grown mans ass rubbed in her face then have her face shoved towards his crotch nni have never laughed so hard in my life it was too much fun,4
outstanding chinese in the wasteland of central illinois get the salt and pepper chicken this place appears to be hardcore no whities while i dined the menu has a special section only in chinese strange sign on the wall says please clean your table for the next customer,3
delicious after dinner cocktails white chocolate martinis caramel and coffee deliciousness kinda pricey but yummy,3
we had dinner there and it is a big must no go if you want bread its 15 very average food coupled with service that you would expect at dennys  yes he is thomas kellers brother but thats where it endsnstay far away there are way to many fine dining spots just right around the corner,0
food excellentnservice goodndecor tastefulnnmy only complaint was the music was so loud we had to yell in order to hear each other it really ruined the experience,2
all the food here was good i guess i was expecting more though from a restaurant by such a well known chef it was a bit overpricedeven charged us 10 for a small bottle of water it was a relaxing atmosphere despite the fact it opened up to the main area of mandalay bay,2
horrible   dont bother,0
jetais tres contente avec la nourriture ici et jespere a manger encore parla translation i was very happy with the food here and i hope to eat here again merci beaucoup pour lexperience tres extraordnaire,4
i love sitting at the bar its a wonderful experience  the food was delicious and the execution was right on  i wasnt crazy about every dish but i was able to appreciate the skill that was involved with everything  its a pricey restaurant but worth a visit,3
tasting menunngo for the tasting menu they will ad hoc a wine pairing if you ask and go for a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchenprep areannunique and flavorful memorable dining but relaxed atmosphere  exceptional meal and we have had it many times never disappointed,4
great service quality taste and atmospherennthe problem is that its way too expensive and not enough food  i know i know its vegas joel robuchon french blah blah blah  at least fill me up  btw i got the chefs tasting menu and ate a bunch of bread,2
as a fellow cheesesteak lover i have to try it when i see it on the menunnnot a fan here  first if you want me to come back why do you nickel and dime me as a customer  thats just bad business  15 for my meal  its fast foodnnanyway ill sum it up  no thanks,0
slow service and 1520 for mediocre philly cheese steaks  sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor  also the televisions are blaring loud if you have sensitive hearing beware  seating is limited,1
had their kalbi tang  good quality not very greasy like ive had at other restaurants  good banchannnlooked to be a bit pricey on their bbq menu but good quality and close to ti,3
from being greeted at the door by the owner to the kind and gentle attention one seated the experience and ambiance matched the excellent quality ingredients of the food  great value for the money  recommend come early evening or very late night  the place is packed with locals and tourist,4
great little coffeeshop and italian bakery good place to sit and peoplewatch pizza place in the back looks delicious and inexpensive,3
i had a strawberry cream puff and it was stale it tasted like it had been sitting in the case for about 12 hours which im guessing it had i was very disappointed,1
the best part of our meal was the fruit fly i accidentally consumed while drinking my wine second best was the cheddar smashed potatoes from a box third was the steak pictures and further comments available upon request,0
i love my wet and sloppy ribs,3
love this place great biscuits to start drinks in mason jars staff is friendly and the food is good,4
deelish bbq if you are craving tasty cooked meat and sides of comfort go here lucilles has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu their location is convenient,3
the pork was dry to me but my husband loved it when i brought it home as a left over,1
this outlet sucks  the only store worth visiting is the nike outlet  thats it  dont waste your time here,0
lets go shopping   compared to the charleston outlets these are more up my alley read typical joe shmoe with some haute shops sprinkled in  plus it has the lane bryant outlet for my fellow big girls,2
i have to admit i thought it was going to be better at its price its goodbut paying a few dollars more gets you better indian in pgh sweet woman owns and operates the store but please try it and give her some support,2
over rated food this place needs a good chef i dont plan on dining here again  pasta is so cheap but why charge ridiculous amount of money,1
hops on tap and great on appsnnwe love love love the yard house we are beer drinkers and the beer selection on tap is one of the best in az the menu is great  the food is always delicious awesome happy hour an extensive menu to tantalize your taste buds,4
a new experience in the end it was nasty sauces were bland and had massive diarrhea after wards nnrating garbage,0
high quality food no msg  healthy quick tons of food inexpensive and always left with leftovers,4
ive got at least thirty people hooked on ycs they need to come to phoenix the foods worth my hour drive but i hate the expensive gas,4
a little pricy but you build your own meal  it tastes as good as you make it,2
this place is disgusting it tastes like they soak everything in margarine avoid at all costs,0
one time i got cold noodles and a bad mealnone time i got a good mealnnits like meh nnbut what are you really going to go eat with all those lines everywhere while you read this review from inside mandalay baynnjust get in a cab and go somewhere reallocal nitll be better,2
great breakfast place inside mandalay bay the cafe over looks the walk way to the poolnnthe corned beef hash is excellent and so are the waffles nnits too bad they dont have refills on juice great place none the less,3
while i definitely agree with the reviews that say the matzo ball sucks i still enjoy the large portions and generally good sandwiches here  i usually go here after work 11pm or so when theres no line or anything so its fine,3
wow has this place went down hill the service and wait staff is an absolute joke the food has went down hill just horrible horrible,0
i had the brisket and the beef was dry to my taste my friends had the corn beef and pastrami and overall the corn beef is the best  overall the food is okay  not sure i would go backnni still prefer schwartz and abbes in montreal qc  25 to 3 stars,2
so be warned this place only has pizza to eat nothing else but the pizza is great new york style thin crust which is my preference and if you dont want it too greasy avoid adding meats to it just stick with cheese,3
its pretty good pho in a nice quiet location charming,2
great club even if it has a small dance floor had a great dj didnt just stick to one type of sound switched it up from techno to hip hop bartender was really nice and fast to get our drinks we went on a wednesday didnt think it would be such a great club we are definitely going back,3
we had vip passes as part of our premier package of o we got to the club about 1230 where we were promptly ignored nnthis club is the epitome of small man syndrome the bouncers are total douche bags,0
so while i was at this club one of the security guards who must have been in a bad mood on this night said stop dancing before i step on your face customer service in vip at its best,0
worse club ever they advetisted  free drinks for ladies but was not true then once got inside there was nobody in there dance floor was empty  go somewhere else,0
by far the slowest jiffy lube i have ever stopped at thought i would be in and out in a few minutes because no one was in front if me but it took over an hour,0
this place is prettty large and awesome a wide variety of organized items video games current magazines books and board games are a plenty staff is friendly,3
do not purchase video games here used games are ridiculously overpriced selling for more than double the price of new,0
plan ahead keep an eye on there web site family fun projects always happening helpful staff they can always direct you right were you need to be good half day with the kids on weekend project days,4
we went there for happy hour the service was super slow and it was not even busy the food was ok,1
absolute favorite steak house of all timenamazing steaks extremly intresting and delicious appetizers and dessertsnvery expensive,4
excellent food warmly lit low light ambiance and good background music unfriendly hostess but waitstaff was on point felt decadent to be there and well try it again,2
oysters good chicken was smelly adult tater tots good took our servicer forever to split our checks mediocre across the board,2
super quick for takeout with a variety of asian fusion options the food is soso but satisfies if you need a quick fix in a hurry,2
this place is cool and jukebox is great but the bartenders are all facing premature midlife crisis the only friendly bartender is the girl whom i wish would be there more often,1
not fancy indeed but a good environment to have some drinks nni only got shocked to order a piu00f1a colada and was denied after that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail except piu00f1a colada anyway i did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention,2
you can not beat the prices of shadys  theyre so low im sure the it somehow correlates to their namenni think i need to readjust my definition of a dive bar  i had heard this was little bit of a dive bar but i didnt see it  its very cozy and a great lounge bar  ill be going back again for sure,3
i miss dim sum new orleans is not a place to live if its a staple in your diet i loved the hustle and bustle of asian familes and the harried staff the dumplings themselves were good the tea piping hot but wished we had ordered some broccolinnthat is all,2
this place isnt bad but its not really good either food wisennthey have dim sum all day and the prices are cheap so that is goodnnbut i wont come here again straight up,1
went for dim sum  it was moderately busy but the carts came around often  the food was decent and the staff friendly,3
dim sum is just not good in vegas i would not come here again but then again i probably wont ever get dim sum when im in vegas nnthis place is dirty and not authentic,1
probably the only place i come for dimsum great prices and selections they are always well staffed and you have dimsum carts always moving and restockingnnthey have this coconut pastry bun its the shiz so goodnnmy favorite dimsum dish is the chicken feet,4
friendly i luv their coconut bun,4
meh okay food three stars because i was hugely disgusted by my water check then picture i added,1
nice prices good food okay serviceit was a nice place to have brunch at with my girls it was new to me dim sum was awesome and all the other foods were good i would go back again,2
went here with family nvery busy restaurant the food was decent nothing specialncustomer service was ok some were rudenpineapple buns are bombnthe parking sucked,2
this is just an ok dim sum place whos saving grace is that they serve dim sum all daynight with a limited selection during off peak hours go to ping pang pong instead unless youre craving shu mai at 10 pm,2
eh it was ok i think circus circus needs to remodel this place havent been here in years and it looks the same  my son had a blast so thats all the matters,2
had to meet a client here for a quick cocktail before dinner being in the four seasons its a very quiet location perfect for uninterrupted discussions the service was excellent our waiter was constantly available without being a nuisance,2
above average breakfastbrunch buffet but then it would be for 36 per person,3
yogurt and granola yuck and coffee sucks  along with their cappuccinos  otherwise  it is great  bagel and lox are great and so is the omelet,2
great concert venue,4
i felt that this little aquarium was overpriced if youve ever been to a good aquarium youll be disappointed they do a nice job with what they have but its not all that much and its not that impressive,1
very disappointed with my visit here was definitely not worth the time and money i did however purchase the 3 for 57 so we chose this the secret garden at mirage and bodies the exhibition at luxor which in my opinion was the best of the 3,2
nice place for the family to discover the wonders of the sea an hour is about the time you need to get around the place,3
really awesome place they have a variety of fishes and animals also there is a spot where you can pet sting rays which is pretty cool i reccomend this for little kids and children theyll love it,3
visited the aquarium sinve it was on the 10 must do things while in vegas nice aquarium but not everything advertised was available an interesting place to visit but im not sure its a must see if you are in vegas,1
we were staying at the luxor and figured we would try the buffet big mistakethe food was gross there was not much of a variety and the salad bar looked like the veggies had been there since the previous night nnthe only good thing about the buffet was our server who was so nice and attentive,0
i dont care how you dress this place up its still a fake dennys i know a dennys when im in a dennys and this is a damn dennys called the pyramid cafe at the luxornnstop lying vegas stop lying,1
i hate to do this but this is one of the worst roller coaster experiences ive ever had  the restraint system hurt my neck  for 14 the coaster itself isnt horrible in fact it has a nice little 180 flip and roll but overall i was dissapointed,0
my friend and i could not get to this coaster haha and we were sober staff was pointing us in all different directions it looked so fun,1
its something you should do upon your first visit to las vegas and not to be done again for 14 i expect to get a free picture at least,2
one of my favorite omlettes of all time solid cup of coffee good ambiance and we sat in what would otherwise have been the window dressing area had it been a retail store great breakfast place be sure to stop in,4
ehh nothing to write home about good service food just average unless you are a veggie loving hipster this place is not worth the 2 hr wait save yourself the trouble and disappointment and cross butler st to franktuary,1
the only record store in vegas left that i will shop at now that big bs cds  records  closed,3
probably not the cleanest place in town but not unbearably dirty either the food however is great the bacon cheeseburger i ordered was excellent the regular order of fries was very generous and among the best fries ive ever had nnand the free peanuts they had out was a very nice touch,4
originally the food was awesome but it has steadily gone down hill  the breakfast gig they were doing was great but its inconsistent on when they actually open  showed up at 930am and still were not open,1
food tasty and generous and also a bit on the pricey side,2
tip 15 minute wait on a packed morning is super efficientnnbreakfast crepes were out of the ordinary  its basically an omelet wrapped in a crepe a must try  too much home style potatoes  good coffee  flip the happy face egg to a sad face egg for prompt service,3
oknyou must go there if only for the chicken fried steakni cant imagine it being any better,3
great service eggceptional food  i wish we had such a breakfast place in salt lake city carla too amazing care of us and our meals were prepared perfectly even though the portions were too big   nnit was my second or possibly third visit here and it is consistently great,4
horrible experience baconcold and old  pancakes dense and hard  potatoes deep fried and extremely salty please go somewhere else their food is not good,0
i love this place best vegetarian eggs benedict and ive always had good service,4
good breakfast spot our waitress was stacie and she was awesome definitely try the banana nut french toast and the eggcellent omelet sooooooooo worth it and itll feed 2 people no problem,3
just finished breakfast amanda are service was fantastic   we sat outside enjoyed the nice weather and savored out banana nut muffin,3
we loved our breakfast  bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet   great service by all the staff   we will be back next time we are in town,4
went for lunch and the service was great we got the lunch specials and the food was delicious food came out fast i will definitely go back,3
good and dependable family pizza spot come here often carry out and eat in with family of kids great service and food try the buffalo bites if you are skipping your diet,4
great food great staff that will make anything you want  all chicken dishes can be ordered as white meat only,4
we used to frequent the restaurant recently the food quality and flavors changed not sure if there is a new cook management or something else so sad about that used to be such a great place to get delicious take out or dine in chinese food,1
good show since tickets were free however had i paid a lot of money i would have been disappointed needs way more animal skits and on more than one occasion there was screw ups piers morgan would have hit the x button,2
disappointing show after waiting over an hour to get in  ushers dont care if you came early for better seating as the sales agent suggested  there is no choice in seating  you have to sit where they place you  save your money for a better show with assigned seating,0
solid  in and out in 45 minutes with a full stomach and not too much damage to the wallet  nnnice staff and good service,2
worst food and worst service  will never go back to red robin  do not waste your time and money  it is horrible,0
bojangles used to be some of the best chicken in charlotte well i see a lot have changed jjs fish is much better,2
i really enjoyed the food here  but as for value to expense my personal roi if felt it was dead averagennwe were in a group lots of sharing and looking at other dishes  i did not have anything that knocked my socks off nnsorry michael,2
lobster potpie was not great the lobster was over cooked and chewy it really had no flavor ive had much better lobster at red lobster it really was disappointing especially for 85,1
food was very good waiter chris provided excellent service  they did sit us on temporary chairs by the kitchen too thoughnnnot much use even posting this because they are closing soon,2
sad to hear its closing was very nice,3
still a bit in the middle on this place  fairly pricey for good food unless you catch the happy hour in which there are some deals to be had,2
awful nothing positive to say stay far far away,0
slow service weak margaritas and stale chips not coming back,0
ill leave one star just bc the waitress was nice but seriously it has to be hard to make food taste that bland and unflavorful it was horrible,0
basic breakfast nothing really spectacular or bad just so so the walnut pastry was kind of dry and the service was rushed and disinterested,1
my friends and i all ordered breakfast the food was mediocre but edible however i was not satisfied if i am going to pay 17 for eggs benedict i expect it to be above average in this case it was just meh,1
it wasnt what i expected going in but i had fun  an hour is more than enoughespecially for someone that never works out  whew,2
i tried this place twice because it was very different  it is different but thats it  the place doesnt have much else going for it,1
it was ok it is like someone who is drunk and this is what the craved for munchies they combined a panda express with a taco bell into one dish also the fried rice was terrible,1
we saw the food network show diners drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner  it was disgusting  all 3 of us were very unhappy lets just say that now when the host of the show says wow thats tasty we think it is code for wow that is disgusting,0
if you want bland boring tasteless food head over to the chino blandido where you can feast on chinese bbq pork and jerk fried rice that is as exciting as watching paint dry all things considered id rather eat paint no doubt it would have more flavor,0
average food  great concept and enjoyed my first visit  however the only really good item is the red jade chicken,1
a great place to go if someone else is paying great sea food excellent decor and if you reserve a view of lake monona,3
this was surprisingly good  we were just looking for a casual lunch and went in with low expectations  but the food was quite good and the service did a nice jobnnim not going to seek it out again but if im standing next to the place and im hungry sure,2
first visit expieriencnn4 star on variety of items on the shelvesnn1 star on the beef shwarma in the restaurantchewy fatty dry tasteless little scorched pieces of meat on top of riceenough saidnngo shopping but skip the restaurant,1
the wor wonton soup comes in a big container and has a flavorful broth crisp veggies lots of wontons and meat  it is great with chili sauce in it  ive heard the peking duck is great but have yet to try it,3
this place is not very good  i like their sesame chicken about 30 of the time  very inconsistent  everything else ive tried are ok or nasty  my coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container  would not eat there,1
i spent 5 weeks out of the country and the first place i spent money upon my return is this home away from home its a great location yummy products priced right and a fabulous staff,4
the atmosphere was really nice love the outdoor patio with the metal art and concretebottle table nice change from the chain coffee shop customers very friendly and talkative my drink tasted yummy but it wasnt frozen enough otherwise id give them 5 stars,3
the cheeseburgers were nasty  when our food was delivered the hamburgers were gray in color and they tasted soggy and flavorless  do not waste your money here,0
great burgers and sandwiches had the pastrami burger with sweet potato fries this time service was good and it didnt take long for our food to come out,3
eh ok food  under staffed slow but friendly service,2
over priced nwe hadnpancakes 900nn1200 omelet runny mushrooms in side yucky only  nnwould not go back cost 60 for three peoplenndont mind paying high price if im getting high quality did not happen,0
typical vegas cafe  nothing out of the ordinary except for our server bobbie jean  she was super courteous attentive and sweet  all servers should follow her example,2
place was filled with employees but not many tables the employees just standing around not really attending the customers,1
this location has moved and changed names it is now called sids cafe and is in the casino,2
i really enjoy this restuarant but does anyone else miss bobby mcgees and its mazelike interior filled with wouldbe actors who honed their craft as servers and theres nothing like scooping salad out of an oversized bathtub thats all im saying,3
had the pulled pork and maccheese very yummy nnstrawberry lemonade very tasty too nice decorambiance and very friendly servicennmy first official food consumed in arizona  it was a fine choicennill be back,3
have to try the brisket and the donuts,3
happy hour friday 4308 can be a full crowd with no parking park at carrington college the free buffet at the q lounge is amazing prime rib shrimp tacos nachos so good and bbq chicken will be going back friday with some friends,4
this place is great meat falls off the bone and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are so yummy,4
omg this was awesome the only thing missing is tri tip if they started smoking that mmm mmm they would have it made chelsea was our waitress she was amazing so funny and on top of her game i would absolutely come here again and ask for her again,4
great service great drinks always at a good price music is cool but the main attraction the tacos,4
happy hour is fun  great food and drink specials,2
that place its bad and overpriced ndont waste you money and time,0
food was god awful the mole sauce tasted like they used powdered chocolate just tasted weird my parents live close to the restaurant and i was craving mexican as im from nyc and there is not much selection in terms of decent mexican nnif you are in henderson avoid this place like the plague,0
i love this restaurant it has great ambience and the food is wonderful i particularly love the guacummus guacamole hummus sliders its a great place to meet friends and colleagues,4
all of their food is great servers always have an opinion on what you should try if youre indecisive and theyre always spot on bartenders are fun and always attentive but not too inyourface great place to catch dinner andor drinks with friends or family,4
bluecorn enchiladas were fantasticnyou pay for chips and salsa that are supposed to be made when ordered but mine werent pricey but good,3
i love this place the pork green chili mac n cheese is so good i dream about it mojitos are awesome made by the guy bartender who is super friendly and sweet we always sit at the bar just a really cool place to have some really good food,3
its a starbucksnneach gate section has one on the secure side  at some gates it is centered like a it is located at the split  with the c gates it is only located in one section of the c gates,2
i am a fan because they do not price gougenthe price of a cup of coffee is the same at the airportnas it is outside at any other starbucksnnkudos to starbucks,3
i ordered a noodle bowl and some breaded shrimp the bowl was small and barely had noodles the breaded shrimp was dry hard and tasteless this place was a waste of money and i left hungry the food is better next door at the 808 sushi place or at hawaiian flavor,0
i give one star not because the food was bad in fact we didnt get a chance to try the food walked in and they said no more orders  thats bad when youre open for 20 more minutes nits hard to earn new customers and we probably wont go out of our way to come back,0
tried petrossian bar twice during my recent trip its an excellent place to sit relax have a drink and people watch you can play spot the prostitute  their red ruby drink was delicious,3
skip this place and go to another gate if you have time if you dont have time i would reccomend a nathans hotdog or something out of the trashnnthe place reeked of old beer the waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and were not too interested in making good time despite being near the gates of an airport,0
its a bar in an airport so they kind of have you over a barrell the bartenders are usually pretty friendly the prices are over the top and the food is not so good id say what do you expect its in an airport but i have had good reasonably priced food in airportsjust not in phx sky harbor,1
pizza is great service is always really good its incredible family friendly kids can walk up to watch pizzas being made and get a ball of pizza dough to play with veggie pizza actually has real vegetables on it and there are always good beer specials garlic knots are fantastic too,4
i dont know why this place has low ratings its good for a franchise restaurant and way better than olive garden on sunset decent service and the food is always on point,3
went here once for your curiosity and once because i was dragged here fat burger is mediocre at best its overpriced and takes wayyyy too long to get your food in n out kills this place and is almost have the price i would rather go to burger king or carls jr and those places are shit,1
the service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food especially the appetizers  for a fancy place the prices were unexpected meaning lower than i expected due to the fanciness  ie  dry aged steak for 25,3
excellent food and excellent service  the manager kristen was awesome and so was our server jeff i highly recommend this restaurant for dinner,4
the barbecue was good but not great they do have a nice selection of barbecue sauces the complimentary kettle chips were a nice touch on the plus side the food came lightning fast,3
good texmex food live close so easy for me good margaritas decent service prefer the local mexican places but this place is good and closeby upset that i dont get my work discount anymore  but will return,2
oh yum yum yum  i couldnt decide between a few flavors and settled on vanilla mint and loved it  i need to go back and have the peach  ni was stuffed so couldnt order more than a small theres always next time,4
we were exploring the city and decided to stop inwe opted for the roof top seating and loved it  food service and drinks were all great  the roof top seating was fun  it was a great time,3
i havent tried many items or the lunch buffet yet but from whatever ive had here i would say its a decent option for indian food being a vegetarian its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food,2
i did not like this ice cream i had a few bites  threw it away didnt have the flavortexture of the real deal it looked like ice cream had all the proper attributes of ice cream but it wasnt maybe its an asian take on what we know as ice cream me no likey,0
ikea is heavenneverything is amazingly chic and cheapni dont like that there is only one of these havens in arizonani think tucson deserves oneni am going on wed with john anwe will go for three frames but come out with a lot more,4
ikea is fun to walk through but for me that is the extent of it my personal style does not include the sterile college dorm look but it is fun to see what odd little things they have in the bins now that i think of it i did by some cable lighting for my garage there a few years ago,2
breakfast buffet was decent food quality was average and so was service,2
decent breakfast buffet i liked the omelet station some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while but decent selection for 15 ours was free with our hotel stay,2
no with all of your other options in vegas for buffets wicked spoon bacchanal this just doesnt cut it food was dry sitting out too long and the cheaper price attracts a cheaper crowdif you know what i mean youre in vegas spring for the good buffet,1
terrible buffet for 35 bucks pizza was old sides had been sitting for awhile dessert tables were a bit of a joke compared to other hotels spend the extra 515 bucks and go to arias or ceasars buffet even paris has an equivalent or better buffet overall unimpressive given that its the mgm,0
marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating  we used restaurantcom coupon and got stuck wtih an 18 tipwith no service seriously  felt scammedthink we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price  avoid this one just not worth it,0
since the owner offered to make it right i have improved my rating based on his interest in customer happiness i always try to be fair,1
if you like overpriced food that really isnt that good a wait staff that is snobby and a cliental that is a bunch of wantabees that somehow paying too much for food feeds their egos and makes them feel good about themselves  this is the place for you,0
i had an okay cobb salad for lunch today along with a glass of wine im not a big fan of laminated menus but they did have a decent selection of dishes it has a tgi fridays kind of vibe not haute cuisine but its keeping it real the service was very good,2
great locally owned spot  food is always fresh spiced right and reasonably priced  not a bad item on the menu  nits in a strip mall so not the greatest location small and about ready for an update  but the atmosphere inside is nice  youve gotta try this place,3
only been here once on a romantic night out with my wifennrestaurant is a little cramped making it tough to enjoy a private meal without occasionally looking over at the folks seated next table and smiling back waiting staff is excellent and explained the menu very well food was ok,2
always good and they reopened much better divers scallops and chick peas who would have thought but they were great my girls loved the cheese pizza truth be told i thought it was quite good as well,4
i love this location wow you cant go wrong with anything you order here love it,4
now this airport is much nicer not perfect but much better than one in texas huston nnpeople are welcoming all is good a lot stores and restaurants i love to shop while im waiting for my flight so its all good,4
breakfast was surprisingly good salsa had fresh cilantro and lime wait staff were friendly and responsive all good,2
threeandahalf star food at five star prices its not a terrible place but you can find better food at better prices elsewhere on the strip keep looking,2
the house made ginger drink is as good as we heard,3
do they really need another review they are awesome you should eat  here,4
one of the best restaurants in las vegas never a bad meal here i was in vegas in april and we dined here as usual and then again last week we will be back in vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will dine here all 3 times its just that good,4
awesome stadium bars everywhere its impossible not to get a beer i had a full scale bar right outside my section as far as the seats go pretty nice view you get almost a good view anywhere you sit cup holders ftw,3
a decade later its just not the samemaybe im just older now maybe its the crowd eh whatever it was or is its just not the place for me,0
had dinner on 050208 we had no reservations and just walked in which made it a plus the service was great the decor and atmosphere made it fun and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and the star rabbit sake were awesomedefinately recommend these two,3
the food was pretty good the service was pretty good the problem was that it didnt really fit the bellagio feel it was like a straight up diner not a cafe in a fancy hotelnnexpect a diner not a cafe,2
waited an hour for a cold 15 burger when i got back the second time it was warm but not worth waiting for,0
not impressed decor is nice but thats about it waited to be seated waited to have order taken waited for food the came out undercooked and wrong expensive i do not recommend,0
i ordered 3 eggs and bacon  includes three pieces of bacon that didnt look very appetizing and cold toast i expected better from bellagio i have has better bacon at mom and pop placesn,1
took 30 minutes for a beer however the burger was excellent  staff was very friendly and apologized for the delayed beer and was very good about recovering from the mishap  we came back the following morning for breakfast  again slow service and a slightly less friendly staff  oh well,2
save your money and eat a hot dog while watching the game,0
went to an event there last evening their walu is to die for fresh and delicious not to mention their selections of different maitais i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour,3
the end is near went for one last hurrah before closing  love westroc and their products but the thrill is gone from tv,0
its convenient if youre staying at gold coast hotelthey have cheap  good dimsum in there  nnthe only downsideservice is slow if youre gonna order from the menu or waiting for your checkserver takes a while before you can get there attention,2
this restaurant is the worst place to eat in las vegas  everything you dont want in a restaurant is here  bad food bad service bad management and expensivenif youre not chinese or white forget getting a decent treatment from this people,0
white guilt told me this was some kind of racial slur against chinese people yelp told me it was actually a killer chinese restaurant yelp was right so so so so good,4
horribly overpriced but on mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety  i wont come any other day of the week but on monday this place is a gotospot for sushi  good service but occasionally a little slow,2
this macys has the best selection of kitchen accessories if i need anything kitchen related this is the place i go,3
ah best food pizza is amazing salads are to die for and dessert is heavenly love the friendly and chill enviorment have never ordered anything i did not like,4
not sure what all the hoopla is about this pizza it all tastes bland to me doesnt matter if you get the mac and cheese pie or a roasted red pepper and feta pie the crust is so bland and the saucecheese lacks any flavor at allnnnsalad bar is 5 stars btw,1
takeout was a miserable experience here we were told 2025 minutes for our pizza and it took an hour and a half we were charged a service and delivery fee online and it was not refunded when we picked our pizza up,0
this is my first visit to this location i have been to other locations and enjoyed the evening the food was good  however the service was extremely rushed the appetizer had barely been served when the entree followed not a very relaxing evening,2
so disappointed in this restaurant  maggianos  is one of my favorite restaurants in the chicago area however this restaurant left me homesick for the maggianos from chicago i dont know what they are doing here but the food didnt taste the same sad,2
great foodhorrible servicenever going there againso many other places to eat that have fantastic service needless to say the horribleunfriendly waiter didnt receive a tip management really needs to take a look at their help before they lose all their customers,1
my family dined here for a birthday celebration  it was superb the restaurant ambiance is elegant and upscale the service is phenomenal and the food was delicious the price wasnt bad but it wasnt cheap i will be backnna solid 5 stars,4
good spot 1rst time here service was friendly and swift breakfast was affordable turkey link sausage 2 eggs poached hash browns not my fave but i would certainly return for some of the other options,3
been here several times for breakfast and lunch  great home made food  soup is extra good  try the chicken salad sand and potato salad,3
would not recommend food was mediocre and service was not great mcdonald is down the road save yourself time and money,0
dont order the fried pickles   if they werent free with the yelp checkin offer then i wouldve complained  everything else was just soso but i guess not terribly bad for a hotel resort joint  the ice cream sundae was tasty at least p,1
its diner food for the most partbut ill take it after a long night of drinking,1
over priced food food was ok nnnothing really speical about it maybe just the decorations,2
even for free it stunk,0
its ok inside  fried chicken was average and overpricednnot sure why anyone would go here when there are other options near byits vegas  dont do a chain  do that in the midwest,1
yeeeeehawww well the wait was not worth the food  sorry gilleys,0
we had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food we tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces we also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good,2
will never go back again absolute worse service ive ever experienced,0
really better sauce comes in a jar  no basil on caprese salad and swimming in dressing  but what do i know  never had caprese salad with dressing,0
great place to get books for a broke college student  friendly staff and a great selection,4
mehnnclientele is obnoxious  employees are practically none existent theyre so helpful note sarcasm the clothes are awesome too bad they fall apart or shrink if you wash them nnwtf you cant shop online thats absurd,1
these guys just get it rightgreat burgers straight forward toppings hand cut friesive eaten here on more than a few occasions with the family and everyone loves itcounter service is always polite and expeditious enjoy,3
this place kicks candinas ass by a long shot granted you have to like dark chocolate complex flavors and high quality if you dont value these qualities go up to the capitol and get some supersugary nonsense,4
ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat drink and watch sports i love the parmesaean garlic teriyaki and habenero sauces the monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic fries are also pretty good,2
finally found a dish i like a bws  i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty  since my husband is a fan of bws ill be back,2
i ordered delivery waited three hoursno pizza and they wouldnt answer the phone so i drove there they told me they didnt open till ten pm its the next day still nothing i had to call deliverycom and cancel my order,0
excellent lunch today for the six of us the food was delicious and our server was just great brisket and pulled pork were both cooked to perfection,4
i have one word horriblennsouth point hotel screwed up on our hotel and offered free tickets to garden buffet the food tasted bleh it was luke warm and the meat was tough the food was saltynnthe only thing that was good was my fountain drink other than that save 14 and go to another restaurant,0
this place was decent when it opened now its not worth eating even if its a comp meal   eat at the cafe its way better,0
you have to be kidding me  possibly the worst food in vegas  the only thing fresh was the salad and the horseradish  brisketleather tough  chicken bla  dessert was sad,0
lots of options  decent food for the price  not remarkable,2
great steak experience we had an awesome experience with the server last year this year hes average but the food is a ma zing as always,3
great food great server great restaurant one of the best experiences while travelling in the us i am european,4
lily barajas is an awesome manager just remember it takes time for the great food,4
definitely worth the watch we found that they had the understudy performing parts and she often sounded better though mostly just a personal preference for voices,4
this is the best show ive ever seen,4
really really enjoyed watching this show the music is just so dreamy and the theatre is so beautiful i think we saw it some time last year so this post is quite late however in any case my love and i had an amazing time cant wait to go back to vegas and see more shows,4
this was a great venue for my first concert at the joint we saw prince on friday night and would see him from the floor and from the suite what a show,3
this is wonderful we waited about 2 hours to sit but played the slots and watch the fun music bead throwing going on at the bar great place and yummy food worth the wait,4
horrible sushi was not fresh at all like the other reviews have said  lobster tail were horrible too  they did not taste like lobster more like a giant schrimp crab legs were whatever   dessert was horrible  do not go here i spent 41 bucks and was mad,0
25same as carnival in rionnhuge selections our server was such a lovely lady and bottomless mimosa for 27cant beat that plus we came when there was no line on a saturday noon wownnsadlythe crab legs are super duper skinny and the baby shrimp wellnnwont be going out of the strip for this again,1
this buffet was pretty good but kind of expensive for vegas lot of choices to choose from but that makes it difficult to choose if youre not a big eater good place to watch people also  if you gamble a lot this may be a good comp from the casino  not a bad place to go,2
for a seafood buffet i was not impressed crab legs were good lobster tails were small and chewy prime rib was good oysters were small desert selection was small but pleasing overall ok buffet but i dont think i would return,2
very poor value for price paid and when they write fresh fish everyday they might mean fresh frozen products as most of the dishes are tastelessnplease improve the dessert section toonyou have much better option in vegas for 50 per person,0
overpriced for breakfast  nnweird seating arrangementn,1
its simple people  if youre in phoenix this is the place you must visit  you wont regret it fantastic,4
best beer selection in champaign cool atmosphere too,3
great beer great people,4
trendy ass crowd where 30year olds hipsters and bachelor parties are thrown that said great selection of beer there are two locations but i heard the 1 is the better of the two not much seating so get there early to post up change of pace than campus bars,2
friendly folks and unusual items ive always found the quality good and the produce fress i like the dried fruit and nut selection too,2
wow band start and our server left twenty minutes later  if you want quality food and any service avoid  you want a bar that is under staffed and has holes in the restroom walls this is your spot  band was great,0
solid 4 stars good atmosphere great walking distance to everything decent parking  fries are amazing menu has something for everyone a bit pricey sometimes understaffed which causes slow service but all and all a great place and had nothing but good times,3
nice market for healthy food and meats  their meat counter is great and be sure to try one of their many fresh sausages  very little fat in them  produce is good and prices lower than most super market chains  they carry a vast selections of health food brands,4
i dont know about the cowboy boots but almost everyone of the work boots are made in china i have been wearing justin work boots from here for 16 years but now they have hardly any justins at all and its the only boot they have that is made in the usa i am not ready to buy china boots,1
if spearmint rhino and treasures were siblings then spearmint rhino would be charlie sheen and treasures would be emilio estevez spearmint rhino is a lot more fun with a lot more going on treasures is small and booooooring bottle service is a lot cheaper though,2
i thank god i got the tickets for free otherwise i thought this show was one of the worst i have seen in vegas the women were hott but the overall performance was really bad they tried to mix in comedy and singing as well just horrible show i did see only three couples walk out,0
it wasnt spectacular started 1015 minutes late the comedian was the highlight of this show im still googling her youtube videos with no luck some girls were really pretty but they werent in sync much,2
tastes like home made better in some cases nthe tortillas tasted absolutely amazing the carne asada was great you gotta try the breakfast burritos customer service was great our orders were ready pretty quick and it was inexpensive i will definitely go back on my next trip to vegas,4
every time we go it gets worse barely any steak in my california burrito along with a tiny amount of pico and soggy fries,0
my filet was good but when i asked for onions cooked without butter bc of a dairy allergy they said they couldnt do it,2
went here at 1am on black friday the place is pretty ghetto for being inside a casinonnoxtail soup was the only thing worth trying ordered the fish and chips and it was still cold on the inside also tried the steak and it was pretty bland one trick pony in my opinion,1
prime rib special is a steal with soup or salad bar and great desert cherries jubilee is to die for,3
breakfast is always reliable here  the omelets are always made just as ordered the california ham and eggs has a nice big slice of ham again got small for a while but back to size now  at a premium price too and you can get raisin toast instead of white or wheat a nice touch,3
mediocre food and terrible service,1
if u come here on grave until 7am ask for joygreat serverhaving saimin and portuguese sausage and scramble eggsof course with rice ono after a night out,3
oxtail soup oxtail soup oxtail soup,3
best selection of international specialty foods las vegas has to offer there is not anything you cannot find here been coming here for 15 years  it gets better each and every year,4
this place is good for family  the price is right and they serve good beer  the food is pretty good four stars are for the service  i dont like looking over at the kitchen and seeing the cooks eat food while they are cooking so that is why they get one star deduction,3
i know people love this place  i can see why some people would really like it however it felt like i was in an assembly line it is a little pricey there are better places in charlotte i think people are just impressed by the free drink,2
i live within walking distance to eds and i havent been there too often however i have become a sucker for their wings  i love their blackened parm wings  such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy  whenever im craving wings i head to eds,3
the mimosa bar on sundays is tasty and inexpensive i havent had the food but this appears to be a classic sports bar,3
food and service are excellent only thing keeping it from 5 stars is priceexpect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus,3
very nice place especially at caesars palace this was my first time trying dining at a cheesecake factory the menu selection was huge,2
same everywhere still classy though same price no happy hour though,2
excellent service bread was hot and fresh pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable,4
finally authentic sicilian food in phoenix combine it with great service and it is a classic go to restaurant  if you havent been to tomasos what are you waiting for,4
delicious chilean sebass excellent mac n cheese and a great wine selection but the service a little slow,3
service a little slow but when i think about the quality it all came together great food ambience was great for two people romantic dinner in a both menu its mostly steamed broiled and fried very little chargrilled items,3
tried the all lump crab cake after being assured it was as stated on the menu no surpriseno lump to be found,2
we went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a shrunken happy hour menu we ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders they had no taste and were overlooked it seems to us the quality of this place is going down sad for that given the fact we are regulars,1
i hate itnthey charge you twice the amount than you would normally pay at the neighborhood corner sbsnits the same coffee dammit,0
the only thing i can say is that the portions are hugebut a bit bland in taste came here for dinner and it wasnt too busy youll get full but not satisfied due to the lack of taste it just a fancier diner setting i rather go to dennys and get similar dishes for less which probably taste better too,1
chicken and waffles you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde which i can relate   fantastic,4
would have a had a 5star if the wait and service was betternnfood is amazing they deliver on the twisted farm food promise  nnthe fried sage fried chicken and the chicken and waffles were very impressive,3
most vile disgusting breakfast ive ever had shit house a gogo is a great big no no i was so mad when i left at being ripped off by this nasty place cold huge portions of very bad food,0
i got the famous andys sage benedict  it was a little on the bland side but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more,3
hash house a no go      found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor    huge portions  chicken hash was dry pork benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat  bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor,1
great food lots of portion,4
disappointed they  forgot i ordered coffee then didnt refill then food was cold  the two stars is they took my meal off the bill  will not return,1
came to vegas and wanted to try something different other than buffetts i tried this place and i have to say it was pretty good the portions are huge you might want to share they have a variety of food and also specialty drinks overall everything was good,3
omg huge portions you definitely should share i ate chicken and waffles which was extremely good my boyfriend ate the famous chicken thing the guy on man vs food ate and the leftovers fed us for 2 days lol,4
the portion sizes are pretty ridiculous  i had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting  but the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy  i will return some day when im starving to see if i could possibly eat a whole burger here,2
i dont get it i ordered the chicken and waffles like everyone recommended but it was very tasteless and over cooked maybe ill try it again just dont see it though it was large enough for 2 people however maybe 3 since non of us cared for it,1
portions are crazy big but who cares if the food is so sonnalso it has a very politically left vibe which i did not care fornnits worth trying once but i will not chose this one againnni had some pork sandwich thing meh,1
the portions are generous and the staff is friendly and helpful but the food is just ok nothing to write home about i was really interested in going here for quite sometime maybe that had something to do with why i thought the food was so bland i had it built up in my head to be better than it was,2
love this place  huge effing burger for a great price  delicious options,4
omg i am so full  crab cake and the ribs are my two favorite apps there be sure to try them nnpsdont fill up on the biscuit,3
chicken benedict is amazing,4
why do some people recommend this place  it took a long time to get to order the4 food was not particularly special nor reasonable and it was so noisy that we could hardly talk  nopewill not go back there,1
great place massive portions could split one order to 3 every time great place to go after marathons  yum yum,3
i love this place  when i am hungry and want to grub out i love coming here and getting different dishes,4
average taste huge portions,3
usually when i expect something to be amazing it sucks this place was actually as good as i thought it would be i ordered the famous chicken and waffles  good stuffbetween my sis and i we barely finished it the place is good def worth a try and i def would go again when im in vegas,4
not a huge fan of this place and huge is what you get for portions but each time that i gave this place a shot no one in our party has been happy with the food it really is flavorless i have no plans to ever go back,1
after hearing so much about this place we went to have breakfast thereit is way overrated ihops pancakes are way better,2
my favorite place to eat in vegas  my wifes favorite too  we are so happy another one opened around the corner from us i guess that means ill have to go to the gym more though,4
about as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate bland plain and tasteless the only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread avoid,1
mmm dinner here and its so good the chicken sandwich with cane sauce get here early cuz they are busy,4
the view was spectacular and the whole experience was amazing i only give it 3 stars because i didnt think the food measured up to the price however i think what youre paying for is the experience im glad i went once but i probably wouldnt go back,2
if youre reading thisread no further just make a reservation take your ass to the stratosphere hop on that  elevator thats more like a rocket ship eatindulge and enjoy every second of it and thank me later with desert k bye,4
visited the restaurant with a party of six and did make reservations prior the seafood was okay my only complaint would be the over cooked lobster it was over cooked and had that rubbery feel to it nnnot perfect and plainly okay,2
not the best bbqsoul food in town but it wasnt inedible i was a bit disappointed with the brisket but the sweet tea was fabulous nni personally think they are a bit overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you get and i wish i wouldve seen the yelp deal before we ate there,1
kimberly the waitress was nice and helpful when ordering as for the differences in ribs  as for the ribs i ordered spare ribs and the baby back ribs both were good for the sides i got fries onion rings potato salad and coleslaw nothing great  definitely would go back again,2
will not be returning  my company orders from here twice a week when we tried to use a groupon deal we were turned away with attitude  customer service was horrible  once the lady got off her phone to see why i was there will be rolling to another place for my bbq,0
i had fun when i went to this club last year  didnt have to wait in line at all fun times,2
go no farther than the seabass  miso glazed to perfection  we are so addicted to this dish we always order it and let our 2nd dish be whatever  crunchy spicy yellowtail is one of the best rolls in town often we come just for a quick nibble of that  be sure to make a reservation,4
the company was much better than the food  china panda could give them a run for thier money,1
this place was the biggest disappointment ever definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals ive had i ordered the chicken pad thai and gross it was horrible and tasted dry if you do order it  share the portion is huuuugeennthis place gets two stars because the customer service was good,1
definitely hit the spot compared to the buffet we had the night before on the strip nnits better than youd expect  considering its a japanese buffet and not an asian buffet like most others nnthe bf still favors moonstar for its choices but i liked the sushi selection here,3
great food this is a buffet style restaurant with awesome sushi king crab legs and tempura shrimp the only downside is that they close at strange hours in the middle of the day,4
this place is alright theres just way too many bastard kids running around  the only good thing about this mall opening is that it makes seeing a weekend night movie at the esplanade a bit more pleasant clearly this is the happening place to be for yuppie spawn and i couldnt be happier,1
i only went to the target here shopping center appeared to be huge,3
very good bbq here  i wouldnt say its the best but its right up there  its family owned which is a big plus for me  they also have homemade root beer  its a little on the pricey side expect around 10person  another plus is their bbq sauce does not contain gluten,3
i have been there a few times the owner is a gilbert native and a very nice person the food is of good quality the atmosphere is great it is best to visit here during the spring and early summer,2
after a year in portland oregon we have found a single spot for decent bbq and it was much more expensive than joes for much less food we will struggle on here in the rose city loving the city just not the lack of good bbq as we continue to pine away for joes,4
love the atmosphere food was okay for a smoked bbq joint  brisket decent ribs and pulled pork were a bit dry and chicken was good the mac and cheese was delicious,2
ok bbq pretty expensive for the serving size,2
good bbq good beans good mac and cheese i wish they would have done more with the bread my pulled pork came on great atmosphere for a bbq joint,3
order the ribs only next time,3
this place is printing money and rightfully so they simply do a bang up job best bbq in az,4
very good vietmanese sandwiches good price for a good sized sandwich i had the grilled pork one the only downside is the location and all the potholes in the parking lot worth the effort though,4
great sandwich the location is out of the way but ill go back,4
dont let the appearance fool you this had good quality sandwiches get the grilled pork its my favorite really good prices too,3
tried a few items and a flight of all of their craft brews  service was great as well as the food  the manager came over and chatted us up and offered up a sample of their octoberfest which was really good as well  i will definitely come backnntry the baby brats,3
not a bad joint  every time we go into the one at westgate it appears emptynnfood is great  beer is great  menu is diverse,2
overpriced slow and undercooked vegetables the pasta was the only highlight good atmosphere,2
food is just good not great vanilla custard french toast is good omelets are a little bland corn beef hash was sweet and spicyit is made in house,2
yep this is one of the best buffet place among a thousand other vegas casino buffet   it was cheap as well  i would come back again  good food cheap price i cant expect more from vegas buffets,3
hotel rooms are pretty gross carpets are so dirty that our feet got black when we first checked in there were stains on our bed sheets and pillows gross i guess you can say that you get what you pay for cheap hotel at least there was a mini fridgennbuffet was awesome though,1
dont be afraid to try this place out for size the rooms are small as all older hotel rooms are but well appointed the casino itself has a vintage appeal with alot of historic items on display the 777 brewery is suberb and will exceed your expectations no pool though,2
had a scoop of strawberry ice cream here so good they had so many other delicious flavors the lady behind the counter was really nice i have been here before  the quality of the ice cream is good,4
whats not to like about the boulders from the moment you drive onto the property you know this place is special as long as you like secluded and scenic desert  i do  the restaurants and both golf courses are memorable and the staff is exceptional  the boulders is as good as it gets,4
the food was goodnnfood delivery was extreamly slownnour server was good  but between our order and the delivery of our food we could have lost a grand inside the casinonnthe food was good but it is not worth the waitnnps the restaurant was not busy at all,1
it was okay not good enough to come back if they ask you if you want lettuce and tomato make sure you really want it because its extra the fries were good the staff was friendly but the place looks very dirty i wanted to try it and i did bottles of soda pop and plastic baskets for 10 it was okay,1
you get what you pay for here its cheap so you thats pretty much it they do have a happy hour but if you eat as much as an adult you might as well do ayce,2
dolphins do not belong here,0
great experience getting a straight razor shave for the face and head  extremely friendly staff knowledgeable  i will visit this location anytime im in town,4
curry is very dry ordinary taste,1
i have mixed feelings about thisnni hate country musicnnbut on the other hand the food is amazingnnits overpricednnbut the food is amazingnnthey have a good gift shop too  which is also overpriced haha but at least the food is good,2
this is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head they cost a little extra but just get the double its worth the jar live band and dancers great time,4
i ordered a vegi wrap and fries to go got back up to the room and found they didnt include the fries which i watched him ring up as an extra charge if you charge 23 for wrap and fries i expect it to be good disappointing,1
fun bar had live cover band and dj friday night drinks are light on alcohol  but band was entertaining,3
group of 8 and had no desire to seat us did not want to let us split up i to 4 and 4 wanted to put us all on one check not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps,0
i had a awesome time at this club the wait to get in wasnt too long the place wasnt overly packed like other las vegas clubs there is a nice outside area to relax in especially for the summer nights,3
poor mans version of moon get ready for crazy pyrotechnics and smokefog machines,1
the owner at n9ne steakhouse walked the whole gang into rain thanks for hooking it up rain was as spacious as i remembered it i am not really into the trance scene so we bounced after 20 mins,2
expensive drinks at 15 each not great atmosphere since nothing is really exciting about it interesting performances hang from the center ring every 30 min of dancers from ropes etc which added some fun,1
i have been here a bunch of timesneach time i dont pay at allni will only come back if i get dragged here againnrain is okay but it is not one of my favorite clubs in vegas,2
every staff had a smile on their faces we were greeted by all the staffs we stayed in the 1 bedroom suite and it was excellent the only thing we didnt like was the lock on our door it didnt lock in place and we had trouble opening the door every time we came back to our room,3
stayed here for work and for edc back to back imagine that and both times i enjoyed my stay rooms are nice suites parking was easy to use valet i would recommend this place 15 minute walk from tower 3 to mgm and all the food gambling and fun you could want,3
the valet service is good but flawed sunday wait for your car after checkout was around 30minas i was told i waited over an hour because they lost my car and brought it to a different tower,1
this condohotel is okay pros each room has its own balcony con its a far ass walk to mgm,1
very disappointing he did a few magics but i really expected him to do more if you get the ticket more than 40 it is not worth watching also the seats were terrible,0
they are closed new restaurant is terrace cafe and its amazing welcome to the hood,0
great place friendlyefficient service and delicious food got a three combo platter was plenty of food and was able to take a taco home generous amount of chips frozen margarita was strong definitely going back,3
i came here for breakfast and it was delicious the service is pretty good and the breakfast deal was only 349 bigger portions would be nice though,2
four stars for vegas breakfast  had the breakfast special  it was a fantastic bargain for 395  only a few paces away at the mgm where i was staying and would have paid 3 or 4 times that much  it was busy but the staff did well despite being overwhelmed,2
very friendly n the food is pretty good i use to work near by so my coworker n i hit this place up ordered a gyro n some fries n it was pretty filling very tasty plus for the owner being so sweet,4
this place rocks they saw us on short notice and took care of business elvis was amazing was worth the trip,4
jjs is in paris and made it real convenient during my last stay in lv i really liked this meat croissant thing they had almost like a piroshkycant remember exactly what it was but it was super good especially as a snack during the long drive back to la,3
i love their coffee any form of mocha cappucino etc gimme gimme happy happy girl here they have lovely sandwiches and you know i never got to anything else but do try the high test,3
stopped here because we were starvingggg overpriced horrible customer service and not so great food i ordered the cured meat sandwich it was mediocre and basic nothing special ndefinitely wouldnt recommend this place,1
great food outside heaters not working cold,3
very nice place ate on outdoor patio shared a bottle of really good riesling wine all the food we had was very good,3
awesome place great service superb food and fun drinks what more could you ask for,3
food is ok but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a fox restaurant which has about 50 location in arizona and a few other western states the service was good and the food wasnt bad but if you dont want to feel like youre at a cheesecake factory i wouldnt recommend it,2
the manchego bruschetta was amazing would definitely go back to try more if their dishes,3
nice place and very friendly staff the girl taking my order was really helpful and sweet,4
confirm the other posts dont waste your time at this rude place show up at their ppen time and doors wide open but tell you they are closed and not even an invite to come back good to not need the business i guess,0
the seafood is excellent,3
great atmosphere  great service by elizabeth   nnthe food was a little above average  nice presentation just not amazing,3
two words cheap good lunch specials are very affordable and the portions arent too bad so many noodle rice and a la carte dishes to choose from to be honest the quality is better than sam woos come here for lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed,3
we went for brunch wfriends a couple of sundays ago i had the tasso ham benidict wa small ramican of sausage gravey on the side usually over the top it was fabu the service is always great and lunchesdinners also great good beers on tap and good cocktails,3
love this place,3
this place was alright just not what i was hoping for the curry was a little too soupy for my liking the customer service was great we had a really nice waitress but unfortunately i dont think that would be enough for me to want to go back,1
this place really smelled bad i wouldnt have stayed however my friend was already eating her soup when i arrived i did my best to get over the smell i couldnt eat the soup i ordered the lunch special red curry it was really good not as spicy as i wouldve liked but not bad i doubt ill be back,1
once i loved this restaurant nthis is third time we order vegetarian and they had chicken in it,0
this place is no good now  huge portions of rice in the nigiri and 3 of our group came down with food poisoning after eating herennthe yakisoba and other appetizers werent that good either even if you ignore the issues with the nigiri and our getting sicknnwould not recommend ever,0
the wait staff kept on telling us that the bread was on its way as it was in the oven after a 12 hour the bread comes out wrapped in a napking and it was ice cold stale rolls  we laughed,0
the oysters were good but the cocktail sauce they give you was just okay the oysters also had a slimy lookfeel to it nnthe combo pan roast was delicious though i highly recommend it you can order one and split it with a friend,3
the oysters here were really good the price here is very fair for seafood although the reason that im giving this place only 3 stars is because our main entree was drenched in salt we ordered the seafood gumbo and i had to take a gulp of water everytime i took a bite of my gumbo,2
mmmmmmmmmm  just got back from a girls vegas weekend and visited here for lunch on sundaynnthey are now open 24 hours  ooooooommmmmggggnni have never tried the clams on a half shell before but omg  they were so delish and fresh and sweet  mmmmmmmmmnnmust come back very very soon,4
my girlfriend had to drag me there because i did not want to go to the palace station for seafood boy did i eat my words it was awesome the food was amazing and cooked fresh to order not only was the food great but so was the service big thumbs up to steve and ricardo,4
seafood combo pan roast is a must  spicier the better too,4
this is my favorite place to eat in vegas the long wait in line is oh so worth it i can not to wait to eat there next week,4
i was really disappointed at this place the oysters were disgusting not cleaned or sweet the combo pan roasts that yelpers raved about had no lobster and the broth had a lot of crab shell not worth the wait or my time to top it off the chef was rude and not professional never again oyster bar,0
in the past ive looked forward to even craved pho kims fare  unfortunately my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality ive come to expect from this establishment  im beginning to think this place is not what it once was,1
ok food i wouldnt go back not much else to say,1
i went to their newish home off carson treat and was thoroughly impressed with the food im not sure if they got a new cook or what happened but the food was much better the last time i went there when it was on carson stnnkudos to the chef,3
the food was great the service was terrible  waited 30 minutes for our reservation finally had to ask then waited 10 minutes to pay the bill finally went up to the front and paid the bill it is really noisy   if you are looking for quiet and nice look elsewhere,1
service is horrendous lunch buffet was cold so we told them to order us cheesesteaks instead they shrugged off the unsanitary food temperatures like it was no big deal i love their cheesesteaks been a customer since longhitano days very disappointed with the service,1
service was good and the place was big and clean  they have so much competition in town and the food was greatly lacking prices were not cheap for the lousy food my group had i will not be back,1
good american food beer is pricey though,3
enjoyed our one night stay while in scottsdale the night before we attended eagles game at cardinal stadium great location spacious rooms good breakfast and friendly helpful staff my only complaint was the coffee was weak almost like dirty water,4
good food nice prices and friendly people the place is well staffed although they could do a bit of spring cleaning my side of the booth was littered with napkins and what not surprisingly they have delicious roast beef sliders,3
typicalmexican fare  it was pretty good but nothing special the pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in phoenix,2
ordered 2 carnita tacos with ricebeans the food was cold and everything was flavorless the food was gross and super expensive maybe the actual restaurant is better,0
tacos fajitas burritos and more  a good spot to grab some of these food items but it was ultimately overpriced and not the best juicy tacos or fajitas that i ever hadnnservice was spot on and they have spacious dining areannmeh,1
great mexican restaurant inside planet hollywood affordable  a lot of food to share good guacamole and salsa chips friendly and fast service  nice seating area inside and outside expectantly view over all  super satisfied,4
nice club fun friendly girls  if you go try to find jade  she does yoga so is very flexible shes a fun time lets just say i would be incredibly embarrassed if i were related to her,4
all i have to say is grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup and excellent beer selection im a fan of the rogue hazelnut goes just right with the grilled cheese and soupnndimmed relaxing lighting and awesome service,3
had about as much atmosphere as a walkin fridge so we turned around and went to centurionnnsure the house looks nice from the outside but inside comfort and vibe did nothing to make us want to stay,1
my previous review was very harsh but true  i met some friends at the roosevelt last week and the service was perfect  i have had nothing but poor service previously but this new hipster guy that waited on us was a really great waiter  so im upping the stars hopefully the service keeps improving,2
macaroons are great the one i had today was a little over filled but still great flavor i was however extremely disappointed i ordered the greek caesar with chicken  the chicken add was 295 for deli slices chicken the atmosphere has a great feel but they need to turn the ac on,1
parisian macaroon red is very bitter i dont know if it is because of the dye or the almond flour i cant finish it nthe filling is great tho,2
great for either a snack or a full meal i dont think ill ever order nachos anywhere else the sopapillas were also standardsetting,4
yep still darn good  we ordered take out this week and it was just as good as always  i wish that i had a chen  wok in my hood in chicago  why is their lo mein so much better than everywhere else,3
first time i have ever had anything from here a friend ordered the red velvet bundt cake with cream cheese frosting the cake itself was delicious but the frosting was a tad too rich for me i cant wait to try the other cakes they make,3
the buffet is not what it used to be,1
i loved the tossed salad the reason i ate here was because they had sushibig mistake it wasnt good at allbut i found other things that i loved 1999 lunch buffet and it includes your soda,2
i bought a travel zoo voucher for cravings at the mirage and so glad i did  the quantity of choices are slim  compared to other buffets around town but the quality of food was very good  the only thing i didnt really care for was the desserts  i felt it could have been better,2
pretty good lots of beautiful women,2
overpriced rip off its bad enough that they charge 25 for an average weekend lunch buffet but to throw you out at 3 pm is totally ludicrous,1
i would of gave this buffet a 3 star than i thought to myself i really experienced betteralso if i wanted to eat a buffet like this place than i could of stayed in cali and ate a buffet that would of been cheaper nthe whole appearance does look beautiful though,1
went on valentines day and was major disappointment extra long wait for food that was very tasteless we were shocked desert was also a disappointment,1
this isnt going to sound very eloquent but i like alliteration so here goesbayside buffet blows  the food and service are mediocre  nothing about the place is memorable  i would recommend walking a few properties over and going to wicked spoon in the cosmopolitan or the bellagio buffet,1
pretty good food large selection beer and wine were included which was a nice bonus,2
horrific  one of the worst buffets i have ever had  its like going to a hometown buffet  some of the worst food in vegas,0
well pie zanos is no longer at the location on 75th ave and bell   after a short stint here it looks like they packed up everything and moved to 51st ave and bell  the new address on their website is 5060 west bell rd  i hope the change in venue works out for them,3
did not like this place at all it was small and very empty now this could be that it was a tad early in the evening but we left and went right to the mirages other club and it had a lot of people and was a lot more fun 5 minutes after this place  so not sure what the story was on that,1
typical vegas bar beautiful girls serving expensive drinks  happily however they dont torture you too much with beatles music  it is very small and located behind the casino  so dont waste your time if you arent staying here,2
great place loved all the bboy events therenall you can drink is lame with all the watered down cheap booze,4
love the music here on a thursdaynnall about the hip hopnncant wait to dance here again,4
sent back a bloody steak and didnt see it for 30 minutes desert took another 45 min to get there ruined our anniversery dinner longest meal i have ever had to sit thru,1
i was recently notified by a management member that he was truly sorry about the first mishap nice to see someone is keeping tabs on their business first hand especially in this economic climate when bad critisizm can cost you lots of business ill give it another whirl and see what becomes of it,2
one of the places with the best steak and service my boyfriend took me out for a birthday dinner and i couldnt ask for better service or steak the lava cake was nothing but a mouthful of delicious chocolate melting in your mouth looking forward to come back again sometome,4
the food might be good but i would appreciate if the man at the cash were better mannered with customers he seems to think he is doing charity by accepting credit cards instead of cashngo to this place if you dont mind being treated rudely by the owner,2
this was a really great old vegas style show i would recommend and will probably repeat,3
went to an afternoon show with my dad hes 76 im 52 and we both loved it only issue is that there are no servers just a selfserve bar kidfriendly too,3
confession i didnt eat herenntruth i did walk in on bill clinton eating in the private dining room and was promptly told by the secret service to leavennfor the record he looked like he was enjoying his meal,4
ate here for lunch very limited menu service was horrible and the sodas were watered down i ordered antipasti for my meal and the rosemarysea salt focaccia bread both were very goodni heard raos was better for dinner and would be willing to try again,1
very good italian restaurant within caesars palace weve had dinner here twice and both times were great their meatballs are fantastic the service staff are knowledgable helpful and friendly you cant ask for better,3
this place is amazing all the time everytime its one of our favorite stops in vegas and its worth every penny service and food always impeccable,4
oh my gahhhhhhhhnnwhy blow 45 on a few rounds of poker when you can spend it on an entire day pass at qua  answer you dontnni cant say enough about this placeand i am way too lazy to write it all out just trust me this place is awesomeeeeee,4
no complaintsok well maybe one it has nothing to do with the spa it was me i needed more time,4
this place back in 2005 was the spot that started it all downtown now the last couple years its been a joke drinks suck the crowd is pretty bad too,1
the best there is simple as that period full stop,4
calling it the best ball park in america is a total understatement its the greatest ever not a bad seat there pittsburgh has been very lucky we hit home runs with pnc  console but of course heinz field is a turkey as meat loaf would say 2 out of 3 aint bad,4
overpriced deli if i ever saw one but its inside the wynn so what do you expect  i only had the matzo ball soup  giant matzo ball and very good  but i dont know if it should have been 8  inside the wynn though thats a friggin bargain,2
sky high prices low quality tastes i guess you can do that when youre located right off the casino floor by the sports book,1
great place fun a fun social dinner,3
first time visiting brio i had the lamb chops served with mashed potatoes and asparagusnit was great the lamb was cooked the way i liked it and seasoned wellnthe merlot i had was good alsonni dont have a lengthy review to write about brio but it is a restaurant that i would try again,3
great place had a party of 9 a very good place enthusiastic waiter food was great the way the dessert menu is brought out so you see exactly what its gonna look like before you get it,4
never disappoints,4
food was great and reasonably priced with restaurantcom coupon i wouldve gave five stars if the waiter wasnt so cocky and direct,2
small shop in a strip mall  bingsoo is so tasty with frozen yogurt  owner is very friendly,3
i filled my ample belly with oj fresh cantaloupe ambrosia easy over eggs corned beef hash and a tiny spoonful of bread pudding  overall i felt this buffet has slipped a notch since our last visit,1
this is a great scene but the food was not that great i had the filet and it was not  very tender and didnt have great flavor but the wings were great i think the apps are better than the dinner menu  nthe patio rocks,1
cool environment  expensive food rude staff,1
horrible service  every time we go to the vig our servers never come by to check up on us last time we went we sat for an entire hour before the server came back again its a shame because we really enjoy the atmosphere and the food is pretty good,0
i really like the feel of this bar im getting older and dont want the clubby scene of oldtown anymore the wine selection was wonderful and i find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends loved it,3
3 parking fee and the valet has cones on every space this is tantamount to a cover charge and the food isnt that good,0
this is a happening place filled with hot people eating pretty yummy dead cow  with that said the steaks are not that great considering the price  i still like this place though  i mean its a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds with all the people watching you can do,2
in vegas every restaurant is pretty good but n9ne does it better with little things things like the best atmostphere a simple menu where they focus on things they can do well smores one of the best and freshest seafood platters ive ever had etc etc,4
my friend kept saying i have to get nines gnocchi while were here thankfully i followed the leaderthe gnocchi with truffle cream was absolutely delicious nnthe broccoli gratin was also tasty and the ambiance was the best we got to watch girls line up to flirt with pauly d what a meal,3
went to vegas a bit too much but i wanted to take my brother there family trip this time and it was closed mm world is 24 hours or pretty much 24 hours but this place was closed by like 4pmboo,2
every time i come here i want to leave with something  the 16 international flavors of coke is interesting  it costs 7 and they give you a fair amount so you could split it with like 2 or 3 otehr people  must try it  obviously a very touristy place but its fun,3
nothing special  cmus main convenience store  better for packaged goods than anything resembling a meal nice outdoor seating though,1
food and service very good  ran into a few dishes we were not crazy about but overall recommended,3
this place is horrible cant believe how they are still open we went for rw and what a waste of money and time the only up side was the service our waiter was very attentive  but the food was terrible,0
great place to stay but the valet needs workan associate by the name craig mertz was rude and impolite someone should teach that kid how to work in the hospitality industry,1
the food is goodselection is ok  the service is good it is way loud all of the time  i understand that it is more of a sprots bar kinda feel but not being able to hear the waitress was a little frustratingnwe will go back i am sure of it,2
food is great but service for food and even drinks takes forever make sure you have no plans the rest if the night when coming here as you will spend most time waiting for service,2
call it sushi ugh went there on monday allyoucan eat not worth it 1st  not all sushi in the menu can be ordered 2nd the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit there was only one sushi chef we had to wait for our order as there were more people not worth your money beware,0
best place to order delivery chinese food in downtownuptown phoenix super fast always good and hot very consistent and friendly  nnour go to is the general tso chicken two times spicy really good egg rolls and cheese puffs ive also ordered the orange chicken and its really good too,4
this place has great plates ahhh gotta love the comps nlol,4
ate here because we were at the hotel  the restaurant is right in the lobby nicely done in dark wood and with a view of the passing vegas crowd   we had lunch and it was very well done   the service was a little slow but if i was there i would go back,3
im not a big fan of cabelas because their prices tend to be pretty high and many of the products they carry are their own brandso much for variety  the only things they seem to have a large variety of are fishing poles and guns,1
incredible food ribs are great service is fantastic i definitely would recommend this place,4
a go to for a good dinner  we have been there twice and both times were awesome  the service was always prompt and courteous  i have made recommendations to people i know and have always been thanked after the fact by those who have eaten there,4
doesnt matter i what i order im always happynsooo goodni live on the other side and i dont care the drive,4
very good but highly overrated,2
fantastic pizza wownnso good  go get some authentic italian pizza,4
the sandwiches here are very overrated  all bread very little meat  the service is poor  take your business elsewhere,0
shrimp is really good i always get a steak and thats good too the butter cake is delish but the service isnt friendly and i have came back here multiple times,3
had the bone in strip  they state its dry agedand prime it was not prime purely due to the lack of fat marble and i dont thing it was dry aged either  regardless it was tough and not seasoned well  corked correctly but not worth 50 not even close,1
great food and very attentive service martinis are always awesome next time i may try to save room for one of their desserts,3
this is an easy 5 stars amazing decor and atmosphere great selection and perfectly done steaks my favorite is the rib eye bone in,4
i went here only because we had a 90 off restaurantcom coupon and im glad i didnt actually pay full price the food was so mediocre that i determined that they dont put much effort into the food because they assume that the people eating here are already so wasted that they wont notice not a fan,1
good place to watch a game but i would never go there for anything else  the menu is totally sportsbaresque and the food was greasy  good place if youre hungover and want to watch the game  otherwise ummm no thanks,1
i absolutely adore lush  they have so many amazing products and the staff are always friendly and extremely helpful  so far ive only tried the bubble bars bath bombs and one soap  which are all fabulous  i definitely plan to branch out and try some of their other products,4
thousands of people immigrate to our country in the hopes their children will build better lives for themselves many of these children succeed those who dont hang out in metrocenter mall nnsimply put metrocenter is a haven for wanna be hoodlums of all varieties nnavoid like the plague,0
missing lots of stores is old looking disheveled and dirty very crowded despite being horribly cramped and messy everything about this mall screams dont go here id give no stars if i could,0
1 star for the fries that keep me coming back like a bad itch plus one more for the 24 hour bit  for the pure entertainment watching people passed out over their booth awesome,1
love the concept of pilates meets yoga in the 90 minute class i workout often but this class gave me a good sore all over a couple negativesi rented a mat and it kind of smelled bad there was no music during the regular yoga class and i prefer tunes to go with my poses,2
my favorite place to go to de stress  the owner king is a nice guy and really take care of his customers needs very reasonable prices and instructors are amazing,4
food taste good  portion is very small  there is almost no service but charge 18 tip  this is not right,0
dim sum so sad it will make you cry like a little baby that just had dim sum so bad even a little baby knows its bad waaaaaaaaaa nnif you never ate dim sum before you would leave thinking dim sum is short for diminished sumthing,0
july 27 2012 people go around in carts or u can order from the menu the decor is ok overall this place is alright the food is not really that great i would plan not to go to this restaraunt,1
horrible place not happy about this selection a couple of weeks ago  the service was horrific  rude and impatient staff  price is weird and they charge you for everything  not recommended at all,0
the dim sum here was pretty good  and the service was relatively friendly  the location is right in the center of chinatown,2
ordered dim sum for take out when i arrived two of three items were unavailable i asked for two other substitute items also unavailable why did you even take my order when you are out of what i asked for next time save me a trip,0
as a frequent visitor to las vegas i went there last night for the first time saturday 2511 i had an awesome time great atmosphere and the drinks were very reasonable for such a hot nightclub cant wait to visit again,4
host knows just what customer service is friendly and handed us complimentary vip wristbands  more mature crowd than other nearby places which is a good thing music is good,3
amazing food i loved the kobe burger and the lobster mash potatoes   everything was well cooked,3
had incredible ribeye steak  a mac n cheese dish  perfect,4
the duck fat fried french fries come out to start and you know youre in a good place we tried a few things off the main menu but the rib cap is seriously the best thing ive ever had,4
i used to eat here the service wasnt so great seemed like the staff was snooty i only liked 2 items on the menu if you want good food with good scenery and nice friendly staff go up the road to twin peaks,1
probably fine if you are looking for a hostel like experience  avoid at all costs otherwise  very bad for business travelers and a poor value for recreational visitors as well  still cringing at the 12 buffet of makeityourself instant oatmealnna memorably bad hotel,0
go to the real thing in lannbut if you do make it to this show youll find the crowd fun the host smarmy the barkers beauties disinterested and the prizes a bit shabby nonetheless i enjoyed the 50 show screamed my brains out over dinette sets conair curlers and plinko chips,2
good wine selection but the dude named paul asked me if i need wine glasses or am i going to drink it out of the bottle  hu  i have wine glasses thank you  rudeness tells me why he hates working here unless its a bad joke probably but still inappropriate,1
good bang for the buck buffet its been awhile since ive been here but i go for dinner they had hand scooped ice cream  it is cheapnnthe meats were decent  not 5 star quality but it isnt bad you just need to find something you like,2
terrible service everyone in our party was forced to order their own entre even though some of them were not hungry the entre come with nan the waiter refused to substitute them with similar priced roti because the chef was unwilling,0
pretty expensive compared to ghandis just down the street  food was fine but not wonderful  a bit nicer ambience than most indian places,2
the service is not that good and the food is also not that great,0
had the lunch buffet for 1495 all the basics included as good as any indian buffet ive had and i like to think ive sampled some good ones certainly wont find a better deal on the strip for this quality,3
where can you get 20 dolla porridge and wish you were eating all you can eat king crab at caesars  nnhere    nnwhat was i thinking,1
zeroncame here at 940pm the gal told me they were taking to go orders only but she they supposedly close at 10pm really i wont be back ntheres too many restaurants to choose from around here,0
after trying this place for a second time during lunch i found the food to be considerably better i didnt order the sushi rolls and instead ordered kung pao chicken and was pleasantly pleased,3
i got food poisoning here last week  and the mgm has been less than helpful in recovering the costs of having to change my travel plans etc  i have never been so sick,0
food and service were okay among the dishes i ate were sweet  sour soup and tofu with baby bok choynnthe decor seemed fancy i liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the woodcovered menus,2
this is the best shabu shabu i ever had if you wanna try the real japanese hot pot this is the right place they serve food quickly and the lady working there is very nice and the kobe rib eye yummy yummymy favorite definitely wanna come back again and try the sukiyaki this time,4
this place has amazing shabu the service is amazing and their meat is true qualityncant wait to come back here,4
i thought that this store was going to be better than the stores i have been to in california,1
underwear for 1 and bras for 10 yes pleasennnnnnnnnnnnnnndisclaimer only in the sale section and only if you can locate your correct size,2
this was my first and last time here i got the vanilla bourbon gelato it was overpriced and old it was not creamy but had started to turn icy i will go to enzos or angel sweet instead enzos has awesome cannolis,1
very sad when this place burned down  loved their hawaiian chicken looks like they were taken over by some new outfit,4
this is an interesting place worth the trip to tempe ok food ok tap ok service ok atmosphere been back three times so far and will go back again,2
easily one of my favorite places in arizona let alone tempe  and thats from day one i was pretty late to the cornish party  the atmosphere is unbeatable feels like im in san fran or london  the steak  blue cheese pasty is fannnnnnnntastic,4
pasties are good yes the service at this location blows who wants to drive all the way to mesa though,2
service was awesome had a waitress that was very attentive and gave great recommendations leak soup by far one of the best soups i have ever tried very unique food but good,3
amazing place,4
the lil bit o salmon is off the chain hearty and delicious service is always welcoming and the desserts are awesome i hate that it gets so crowded at lunch  but thats what happens when you serve up solid food for decent pricesnnyou have to try this place definitely a hidden gem in tempe,3
gross,0
great foodbest greek salad  a little small gets crowded fast prices  good   love the new one in old town scottsdale,3
their soups are great the service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot the employees are kind of a grunge crowd however last time i went i got food poisoning i would say eat there but the food is the only good part about it good selection of beer winenot at all,1
i ordered their cafe latte it was so plain and no coffee taste at all wouldnt visit their store a second time,0
wonderful employees,4
price was right cool concept but i like 5 guys better what a burger is my favorite burger guess you could say im old school in and out was busy and had good service but as for the burgers a lot of hype,2
always good  the perfect junk food fix that really tastes goodmy guilty pleasurennthe team here is consistently efficient  friendly,3
visited it yesterday the design inside is pretty simple  feels like aquarium sushi are overpriced and not good as expected not worth to visit at all,1
great food but not worth the rude and terrible service at the sushi bar,2
i enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon  i love the shakes and the animal fries are super good  id much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side,2
who doesnt love an inoutburger when your bored or hungry late night and nothing else is open high protein high fat meal very good if your in your bulking stage of the year always friendly customer service and food is cooked in a timely manner thank you for the great meat,4
i ordered the honey hot wings the wings were nasty they looked old and did not taste good at all sauce was horrible too,0
i think the quality of food has declined recently and even got a little sick after eating there last time  its too bad because it used to be a great place,0
i had a really nice waiter and the food were great the waiter helped me choose an entree by describing what was in it he made it sound really good and i ended up getting it taste magnificent,3
my family and i came here last night to celebrate a birthday there were 12 of us and we got the  best customer service the food was hot when it came out it was a wonderful experience last night,4
i keep giving the grand cafe a second chance and then i keep regretting it the service is incredibly slow and the food is only mediocre,1
extremely slow service go elsewherennquality of the food wasnt bad but ladies and gentlemen you will have a few birthdays by the time the food comes out,0
this place can be wonderful or a disappointment depending on how wellstaffed it is when you go there late night specials are outrageously low priced like the old las vegas maxim cafe now long gone  the tbone special can be great or just okaythe daily specials are a great deal,2
it was huge and had a cool feel they played really awesome music and it wasnt too crowded it did a bit crowded but i really like that its connected to the playboy club so that we are able to hang out there when we are tired of the larger crowd its a true vegas experience,4
529  waaaaccckkk the only thing nice was the view other than that crowd was wack there was no where to sit small danceflr thank goodness it was free rain is better than this spot,1
ok if youve never been on a club on the strip before then youd probably rate this a 5 but if you have well uh boring   it was a friday night when i went and it was boooorrrrring  empty  lonely  i guess the only good thing about it being empty is you wont catch the swine flu lol,1
great breakfast foodexpecially the skilletsnconsistent style and portionsi really like the chicken bacon avocado skillet however im not a big fan of the coffeei think its quite bitter but they have fresh squezzed ojand great whole grain pancakes,3
im not typically a breakfast kind of guy but occasionally i get a craving for breakfast foods whenever i get this craving us egg is my goto place the halfandhalf breakfast is the best of both worlds you get a great egg and potato skillet plus their awesome protein pancakes,4
ive always had good service here unlike the tempe location ive never had to wait and the food is always fresh and yummy also totally saw dan majerle waiting for a table there once,2
this is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service the owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves try the half and half to get both,4
food was very good with nice size portions  wait staff did a great job and owner walked the floor checking and keeping things in order,3
took my buddy here the other day to nurse a hangover great food reasonably priced definitely did the job for us they are open til 2pm serving breakfast friendly staff they brought us pitchers of our drinks so we didnt have to chase a waitress down everytime we wanted a refill i like that,3
my first time here and i will be back i was craving mad greek gyros but this was the closest gyro location with the best reviews far better than the mad greek it tastes so fresh and if youre like me and enjoy real food youll love this place just look at the picture,4
the portions are tiny and the prices are very high i ordered an orange juice and received a shot glass of it after receiving the bill the oj was 7 and my bagel was 5 this is the definition of a tourist trap,0
great food except for the chips  kind of disappointed as that is one of those cravings you want satisfied when you eat mexican  service ok not great,2
the casino is old schooland so is thier restaruntbut if your looking to have breakfast you sure cant complain about the food or thier prices,3
ghetto run  dirty unsanitary would be giving this place a compliment  we will never bring our child there again as soon as they take your over priced entrance fee expect zero customer service  only one ride operator the whole miserable two hours there  no thank you,0
this place is great went for happy hour and had the best time nbest bartenders so attentive and great made the best drinks ndelicious food i mean so tasty ngreat atmosphere nall in all love this place,3
im not too fond of sushi so there is not enough variety for my taste but what they have is goodnnevery drink you order is way strong so you keep buying more and get so liquored up you dont realize how much youre spendingnnonly been once not in a rush to go back,1
this is the spot for happy hour kids are welcome but only in the patio the potstickers and ahi wonton crisps are my favs chase it down wa glass of house chard and call it a day beware of the cougars and the men dressed in ed hardyaffliction gear lol,3
the quality of the food on the happy hour menu has gone down ordered the calamari and it came out stale and mostly all batter,1
food was excellent had the potstickers and sushi sampler karen was our server however was dissapointed waiting 35 mins for our check after table was cleared and dessert was already refused plus excessive chit chat while waiting for our bill while still in plain sight is very unprofessional,1
bloody mary amir 70 degrees kona and vland perfect great happy hour selection beautiful outdoor venue great drinks delish pad tai,4
potato latke rachel is unique and genius flavor is excellent and the sandwich melts in your mouth reasonable prices and large portions great experience,4
good fresh tasty abundant good value  say hi to micky,3
having a small dogs its comforting to know they can be off the leash with other small dogs in an open cage area,4
we were a bit dubious about this restaurant because of the location but boy were we happily surprised it was a home run i had a tofu dish and my fellow had the noodle soup and both were outstanding it is worth a trip to this dowdy shopping center just to eat at truc and it was so cheap,4
i wanted to order a gourmet burger as their sign advertises when i tried to order it mediumrare i was told mediumwell or well only huh gourmet burgers and you wont even cook to temperature if you dont trust how your meat is being handled im sure not going to,0
white chocolate raspberry  ftw,4

this place is yummy once you walk in the atmosphere is pleasant and the service very caring the food just rocks tastydelicious nif you love thai like i do this is a total must try i am sure it will become a favorite like how it has become mine,3
this place is one of my favorite thai restaurants in las vegas the panang curry is so good even my husband who is not a fan of curry loves it and their tom kha kai is amazing other favorites are the fried rice and pad see ew with beef nnthe service is prompt and friendly,3
another thai surprise i did have the som tum and it was just ok they used string beans instead of long beans the dressing was not balanced enough for my taste it could have used less lime and more fish sauce nna pretty decent curry nice green tea definitely an ok place,2
nice ambience and delicious food its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing this is my favorite thai place in the area i wish they delivered during the day though,4
omg what the heck did i do i came here again by mistake ordered the satay that is noooo chicken again inedible well they havent gotten any better in 2 years jeez i knew this place looked familiar,0

took me 1 hour to get a fish sandwichthey told me it would only take 20 minutes ridiculous,0
so so foodbut i liked the patio  better food and cheaper can be had at elmers or filibertos,1
good family dining outside,2
free bean dip and salsa the chips are hot and fresh the portions are large so splitting helps to save money i loved the mango margarita and the ambiance is fun great location,3
i loved this restaurant from the ambiance to the menu to the food and especially the check  huevos ranchero and coffee under 9  it was all great ill be back,4
what a rip off  ordered margarita and they scammed me for premium tequila and when approachedthey said too bad you drank it you pay for it    too bad restaurants have to price gouge to make their numbers   i wont be back,0
laid back atmosphere fresh food very open seating delicious food plenty of parking,3
stopped going here with the management turnover and decision to go away from 1 pabst low drink specials and 50 off sushi during happy hour  nnif i do go all the sushi is fair game as good also since there is some hawaii fusion with the food you gotta get the fried rice  yom  yom,1
basicaly you get what you pay forni had this the night before we left and i made four bathroom trips on the way home,1
what can i say about this place that hasnt already been said it is a vegas buffet its got a ton of choices none stellar none crappynnits perfect if you need to fill up fast while at the excalibur and not waste your time deciding where to go eat,2
its 6 months later  and i still hate this resturant  i want my money back plus the day i wasted at the excalibur this place is a epic fail,0
i have no real complaints about this buffet  it was decent way better than the buffet at the luxor even though the food was similar  i wouldnt seek this one out but if you are staying here then its worth the convenience for breakfast,2
very basic and nit very good plastic scrambled eggs bacon sausagefruit cereals and ughurtkind of like a high school cafeteria really bad when you compare it to m,1
fine place for anytime beakfast certainly a step up from dennys or ihop good omlettes and if you can take the heartclogging properties biscuits  gravy also serves sandwiches salads and smoothies,3
god why did i ever go backnni had low expectations coming here again because of what it was like the last time but this time it was worse we sat in these seats which reeked of bo and had to move several times to a seat that wasnt nasally offensive wtf,0
have not been there in a whilesorry i came back place smell like pine sol real bad bearly no meat on the gyro pita no dressing on the greek salad,0
this building itself is just beautiful even if you dont step inside the reading rooms upstairs look like something from inside a palace or cathedral the call system for requesting books from the stacks below was way ahead of its time take the time to check this place out,4
went to valley luna on a sunday for the specials i found using the happy hour app 2 drafts and mimosas got there asked about the specials they would not honor those prices said theyre 250 i decided to leave and the waitress bad mouthed me to my girlfriend,0
went here for happy hour and sat in the cantina chips and salsa were delivered immediately and were delicious our server was kind and on top of it the meal i got seemed a little over cooked but besides that everything was delicious and their happy hour prices were great,4
great food great service great atmosphere99 of the time the bar can get loud and obnoxious if the bar is full avoid it the dining area is very nice order a cheese crisp and a beer this place does mexican comfort food right,4
i came out from california and was looking  for good mexican food what i found was a diamond in the rough the tacos were great the staff was on point and did a great job will be coming back,3
terrible service terrible food huge disappointment the food is plentiful but nothing special well go back to arriba,0
this place is amazing very crafted cocktail that taste wonderful they have a smash of whatever type of liquor you like with whatever fruit you like muddled into it with some triple sec for sweetness i chose strawberries and lemon with vodka and it was so fresh and delicious,4
this is where i usually go when visiting downtown the atmosphere is great i think its what makes this place its dark with a fireplaces and brick walls there is also a dance floor and dj in the back last time i got a pretty rude bartender though only negative thing i have to say,3
the interior is phenomenal and the music was great get there earlier if you want your conversation to be heard better but still a great place to kickback with friends,3
enjoy this bar very much always a must hit for at least 2 to 3 drinks when ever i go downtown this bar is always a bar that i hit great spot highly recommended,3
cool bar  kinda reminds me of this bar in the burbs of cleveland called johns cafe i used to patron everyday   and i love the indoor fire pits,3
just nothing good to say grilled salmon and grilled veggies swimming in oil and the salmon was burnt server never ask if ever how it was i guess i shouldnt leave out that the rice tasted like it had been sitting around in a warmer for days,0
food was great service lacking sat at sushi bar sushi chefs attentive but rest of staff a little amateurish i would go back but i was dissappointed in overall service,3
always fresh and perfectly prepared this is the only place my husband will take japanese visitors from out of town enough said,4
god theres a lot of hookers in vegas  this place in particular really seems to ring their bellnnthe standard 15 cocktail rule applies here served by either bartender a douche bag or bartender b hobitch,1
such a great experience im always hesitant on someone cutting my hair summer was great she did everything i wanted was very professional will definitely be going back to them again,3
sorry  not impressed with the pizza  greasy  could not finish the 1 slice i ordered  salad was blah  free popcorn had no taste no salt no butter  blah  not returning,0
amazing food quality had the tuna sashimi appetizer amazingly fresh and wonderful flavorsndinner was tilapia excellent choice and perfect portion sizensave room for the cheesecake it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce,4
overhyped tgi fridaysnnate here on a business dinner while in phoenix  it was not a memorable experience and i would recommend that anyone considering going here takes a look at anywhere else nearby  fiveguys burgers would be a better betnnsorry not a place i would like to return to,1
yum nuff said,4
excellent pulled pork sandwich 100 pork no fat also very nice french fries my husband had an amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also,3
the lunch meals are great i did have a bad experience with the egg foo young i could not eat it at all,1
worst big city paper ive ever readnnjust about everything printed is verbatim from the wiresnnthe entertainment writerscritics suck and all with a right wing lean  yuck  well worth it to get the new york times delivered,0
this restaurant gave me a lovely case of food poisoning  need i say more,0
outstanding food was great and the service was outstanding too i had chicken and my wife the spaghetti and meatballs both meals were outstanding would for sure eat here again little pricey but worth it,4
felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top,2
amazing food have been here twice very intimate setting good service  great food ngarlic  spinach nan was so yummy so is the chicken tiki masala,4
the moules frites is the best  hands down great ambiance,4
always a great meal the food is out of this world one of my fave places in the east end,3
we had a second gift certificate to use so we went back for lunch this time and stuck to the mainstream of the menu with a pork chimichanga and a pork burrito both of which were enormous and pretty good,1
this is our goto place for mexican best taste and by far most authentic around if you dont like real mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door,3
dont let the crowd or lack of crowd throw you off they always serve delicious food as if as you are one of the family classic food done right,2
phenomenally clean and the staff is beyond helpful  they pierced my tongue a few months ago it wasnt cheap but i really would not go elsewhere to have big needles driven through my tongue,3
the piercer kat was awesome and effie aka stef at the front rocked and recommended some good tattoo places great people really quick service and great everything and affordable,4
one of the most frustrating layouts of a restaurant ive ever been to two front doors bathrooms placed too far away from the bar and the dining area strange patio layoutnnfood possibly the best french onion soup ive had in phoenix the burger wasnt earth shattering but was good,3
i had alot of fun last time i went there thier lounge room with the dance floor was cool and the security at the casino were frendly i enjoyed myself,2
love this casino resort off the strip facilities are topnotch even have a tv on the bathtub,3
very uptodate hotel pleasant atmosphere make sure if you want 3g4g access in your room that you stay on the west side pool has horrible hours imho if you want wifi access be prepared to spend a fortune  drinks at the pool are outrageously priced  17 for one drink includes mandatory tip,2
the rooms are great the pool area is nice my only complaint is a very high resort fee almost 28 i wanted to splurge a little and stay at a nice place but the fee made it not worth it,2
horrible customer service didnt see anyone winning at all total waste of money and we didnt even have fun,0
wanna get drunk as a skunk under 5 bucks just sit at a machine over here and play pennies while cocktail waitresses bring you drinks incessantly the moment you walk in they take your order i suggest the adios motherfucker youll thank me later,4
delishbut then again who doesnt like gelatonni had the amarena cherry and it was quite tasty  smooth and creamy just like i like my men  nndefinitely recommended when you want something sweet to finish off the meal  or when you are sweating balls in that nice desert heat when august rolls around,3
ask if they have engawa in stock its like the muscular part of halibut and resembles to the texture of squid such a delicious savory bite im craving that now oh yea and ask for aya she introduced me to so many new things i loved them all new favorite sushi spot,4
if you are las vegas bound and want too see the grand canyon the best way to go is by helicopter with my peeps maverick helicopters stamp by mrvegasvip,4
hard to make good sushi in phx so dozo is already behind the 8 ball  nnjust not great for sushi  rolls might be ok but if you want authentic sushi this is not the place to goaltho im not sure of anywhere in phx that you can get good sushinndozo gets a one star in la but 3 in phx,2
i have been to kincaids for business and pleasure and all the times i have gone there its been fantastic classy and delicious thumbs up,3
great french onion soup and french dip sand,3
no more than average serve and food quality with above average pricing this is my second and last visit they just cant pull off the fine dining restaurant concept,2
great hot chocolate too  no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group  the iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when its hot,3
i like madhouse but this actually isnt a review at alli just wanted to say that when i try to access madhouses website i always get a trojan warning from my browser i think the site is infected i hope the owners see this,3
fresh seafood attentive staff and a nice physical layout nnfirst time visit for ayce lunch will be back,4
the reviewer who described the pizza as tough was spoton this is literally the worst pizza i have ever had in my entire life i would rather go hungry than eat hungry howies,0
nooooooooooo,0
had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price  out of all the places that deliver in tempe i think this is the best love their crust we get the butter cheese and its delicious  the price is really good and they deliver quickly,3
the pizza is pretty good especially at 2am but when it takes over an hour for delivery no thank you i shouldnt have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip thats the best way to not get a tip,1
a one hour wait on a thursday around 845 not cool then having terrible service because its close to closing time definitely not ok foods ok i like their sanwhichespasta but pizza is average not worth the wait,1
took my son to oreganos last night for his birthday loved the guacatony they gave my son a free pizza cookie for his birthday thanks,4
nice little pizza joint good pizza but only so so wine full bar so beer and mixed drinks available  dont go in with high expectations but enjoy the pizza and your company,2
nice little place with great service pizza was good will go down the menu and give it a go,3
lovelovelove  im not too adventurous when it comes to food but i really like their menu  lots of chicken dishes and all sound great  ive tried a few things but none of which i can remember but i know i liked them allnngood mojitos and dancing later in the evening toonndefinately an enjoyable place,4
the service is great and the food is even better doesnt need much more explaining than that,4
chips come w salsa and beans dont be deceived  the beans are spicier than the salsa mix them on your plate  delish good local start mexican joint,2
totally edible chain restaurant food nothing exciting,1
lots of choices on there menu nthe grilled veggie appetizer is very good nnice place with a different atmosphere than an ordinary restaurant nvery friendly staff nthey also make there own soda   which is  tasty,3
fantastic lunch buffett pizza  but also great if you just want a great bowl of home made soup and salad,3
should have never changed the recipes i have been back twice since new ownership i have to say i will give them one more shot the place has lost the touch of service that was given i feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice,1
review is only for the tacos they serve outside theyre 99 each but they charge tax with it i like their selection of meats like cow head and beef tongue and theyve got like 5 salsas but i found their meat to be really tough and lacking flavor definitely a taco stand you can skip,1
yummy cant go wrong with panera the thing that urks me most is the single door entranceexitthis place needs double doors with all the people going through it,3
probably the worst chinese ive had in years sweet and sour had almost no sauce and the kung pao chicken tasted like beef stew not spicy at all not worth half what i paid,0
two stars just for the fun of it  but might be the dirtiest place ive seen,1
the cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired ive had several entru00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them id especially recommend avoiding the nachosnnthat said its a decent place to go late night for dessert,1
ive come here a few times the service is ok but the place itself makes me sick  they blare the music so loud i became dizzy and got a huge headache  i wouldnt be coming back here again,1
walked in and the seahawkers club had just left  the place was a wreck and they were scrambling to get the tables cleaned and the restaurant back in ordernngood service good food and cold drinks  use the 4square app and unlock an additional dollar off your drinks even during happy hour,2
great place to enjoys some pints and catch a game a lot of floor space and a menu worth checking out i little on the high side of cost for pub food but such is expected in scottsdale,4
i go into this sprouts on a regular basis and i have never had a bad experience,3
worst place ever i loved this place before but now i dont go anymore food is not good but service is bad we ordered cold soba but broth was warm so we asked to make cold or change the broth but after 5 min they served same broth as we gave before and that day we found cockroach  so i dont go anymore,1
had chicken tacos for lunch  its fast and inexpensive,2
nothing good happens at club rehab lolnhampton beach nh is the same just add cocaine and ejunkies make the world go roundkeep rollin crackheads,0
i really enjoy what the hale center theater brings  i have seen some great performances and have been surprised at how well the scenary is done and the actors perform  it is definitely worth it  so happy gilbert offers this,3
went to see sound of music november 29  absolutely outstanding performances from the whole cast    enjoyed this play more than any other i have seen there  fantastic cudos to all the crew that changes the sets also i love this theater,4
this place is entertaining as hell  it was a lot of fun to watch seven or so baseball games at once and the beer selection was massive  unfortunately i got so sick from the food that i had to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the night and miss cirque du soliel,1
interesting architecture but thats all that was interesting about this place very collegepub atmosphere with not a whole lot interesting beer,1
if you are looking for beerstop by the pub  the pub has a enormous beer menu  we didnt stop in for food so i cant give any reviews about the grub,2
this place sucks slow service no beer knowledge food taste like its leftover from a recent wedding,0
great family owned business  friendly staff  great sushi and reasonable prices  check them out,4
great place to spend an anniversary they really treat you well the service was top notch fried calamari was excellent with the spicy sauce i had the fillet which was great my wife had the butterfish and loved it the hawaiian martinis are delicious would definitely recommend it,4
get the butterfish,4
not too bad khmerchinesethaiviet food here good fish shrimp and seafood dishes here i believe this is part of the california chain the service is just like any other chinese restaurant just ok parking can be a bitch sometimes but what do you expect its right in the heart of chinatown,3
price and taste is perfect for my wallet and stomach love it,3
great location close to the lightrail lots of shade and ample restrooms however the beer selection is terrible and the food choices only slightly better but lets face it youre going anyway just grab a drink and brat before you get here,2
funny how theres a five guys just up the street but i wanted to try something i cant get back eastnnthat being said i found decent prices good service decent fries and a decent burgernni was expecting more for some reason but innout just isnt on five guys level when it comes to burgers and fries,2
this pizza is like all of the other chains dominos papa johns if your looking for good or desent food go somewere else,1
cheap prices and a great place to get fresh veggies place does get busy on the 1st and 2nd of the month given how cheap the place is so try to avoid those two days,3
i got my sonic fix so there is a couple stars for yannsadly our fries were very undercooked i didnt get any mustard with my plain hot dog and we didnt get any napkinsnnthese are fast food basics people,2
the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable the service is fast and the food was great,4
the girly drink i had was sooooo good nni would pick sierra gold over blue martini any day half off pizzas and drinks for 3 im game,4
typical local bar but id say its nicer than most the drinks are cold and food is descent the pizzas are pretty good and even better during happy hour the wings are good as well nice spot to hangout after work,3
had better service at motel 6 advised front desk of drunk patrons kicking my tires while awaiting valet with my toddler  front said im sorry to hear then walked away dirty towels and bed linen did me in going back motel 6 on next visit,0
beautiful place beds are great but worst customer service only stayed here two times  my wedding night and my sister in laws engagement party  slow service and rude workers too expensive for the horrible service,0
rubios is on the corner it is inexpensive the food is ok nothing to get excited about,2
looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekendsnnit was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share i got to try the sardines cured meatolivecheese plate and sangria nnid like to go a second time anyone wanna come with me,2
i was underimpressed  stay far away from the calamari which came as a lump of fried mass of chewy something,1
overpriced mediocre lack of attention to detail and quality would not recommend dont waste your money,0
a bit pricey but very good food,3
the brisket and drunken shrimp are great  live muic was fun on patio  new owners have done a great job with refresh and menu  new servers are nice  price was right,3

great italian food great sinatra music playing all night everything was excellent from service to desert try out the cigar room in the back,4
this place was soo much fun the food was delicious bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night definitely will come back,4
good food fries are awesome but everything is so pricey,2
i came into this place with high expectations boy was i disappointed overpriced chicken fingers felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil for the price not worth it,1
dirty dirty dirty and their merchandising is with out a doubt the worst,0
slightly above average mexican food one thing that keeps me coming back is they have excellent hot sauce service is always good very friendly staff they do make great nachos maybe i should add a star,3
where would i be without my tjs  i go for everything  wine coffee cheesecake cookies and food  not to mention wonderful flowers,4
amazing  it is 46 degrees outside tonight and my hubby and i had to try this place out  gelato was so creamy and flavorful  we had a combo of coffee and whisky cream and i am in love  great service and for a night that is cold as it is tonight almost every chair was taken  i will return,4
nice place and atmosphere i had the ribeye it was over cooked also tasted a bit off i should have sent it  ack but had a show to catch i actually became sick later night and ruined part of our vacation my wife had the filet she said it was just ok,1
we came here for valentines day and it was outstanding everything was delicious and the service was impeccable joon and his staff made this a very memorable evening for us highly recommended,4
great food and service  currently the best steak ive ever had twice  they are  consistent for sure,3
dont do it just dont youre better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store nnour dish was half hot warm in the middle and cold on the other side the dessert was stale and bland nnbf was bloated like he was in his third trimester and miserable for two days after ew,0
i love paradise bakery i operate a small graphic design business and enjoy getting out of the office to work paradise bakery is very accommodating they dont seem to mind when i spend a few hours there the staff has been awesome and the food is always excellent,4
quick lunch so i had the spinach power salad  pretty quick and easy  salad tasted pretty good  lots of people in there so it was pretty noisy,2
food is great when they get your order right or havent ran out of something  the staff needs to learn how to treat customers betterthus the 2 stars,1
love it very intertaining way better than i thought about a hynosis show,3
i was super excited to see the show i wish i didnt see the youtube videos thouygh because i feel like i ruined the show but seeing people do the silliest things is just plain hilarious,4
oh ya the most incredible bodies on the planet performance is impeccable and who knew the best poplocking ive seen in a long time what a great surprise true cabaret,4
glad my husband and i decided to do brunch here really nice environment friendly waiters and super yummy food the french toast was so delicious a little fancier than other breakfast places they even brought out a foot stool for my handbag i would definitely come back here again when im in town,4
good food but not worth the price me and my husband paid 100 tax and tip for waffles the duck omelet thing and french toast thats it youre pretty much going to pay for the ambience because the food was not up to par,1
went here for breakfast and it was just okay the vegan options were minimal and our meal was just ehh,2
i had a nice little breakfast crossiantsandwich here and it was delicious place was clean and busy go small business,3
underwhelming service and subpar facilities,1
love squaw peak 4 star rooms with a 5 star experience good for a staycation theyll bring you drinks while you float the lazy river plenty to keep the kids entertained as well,4
took forever to be seen by waitress not busy didnt ask me for anything to drink food was not bad but not good either got my order wrong nothing to write home about i will not be coming back here,1
by far one of the best buffets in las vegas,3
i added another star for their breakfasts if you up for this its worth the 500 per person,1
pretty average italian meatballs and desserts are good here most everything else is average buffer fare prices are always cheaper if you have a casino rewards card which are free to get so there is no reason to pay extra just go to the casinos card services near the food court and get a free card,2
great price and decent food selection discount available if you have players card n699 breakfastn899 lunch,1
decor is pretty nice theres even fishtanks and cozy booths service is pretty quick food is a flop  and its expensive  i dont want to pay 15 bucks for a mediocre taco do you  youre better off going to wendys and ordering the southwest salad,2
generous portions and good food  i appreciatef the choice of black beans in addition to refried beans,3
uhhorrible food and i was even uh under the influencethe kind where anything tastes good and it was still bad i wouldnt eat here if i were starving in the desert the palms was a great place to stay the 247 cafe had great food its too bad the buffet was so bad,0
this was my first visit 32911  i was a bit underwhelmed  i knew it was the largest buffet line and that is fine with me  the majority of the selections looked like they had been there a while which translated into some dry chicken  the lamb shank and crab was decent,1
i read some of the recent reviews and decide its worth a visit  we got huge classes of orange juice lunch is 1999 or 1299 with players card since its new years day  great food attentive service fancy decor overall i am pleased,3
gross the shrimp arent clean the food is random and really poor quality small selection of food all around my free wine was in a dirty glass,1
this is one of my fav spots in south side drinks are reasonably priced service is great and even though i dont usually like bar food their food is really tasty i love watching the pens games there because of the big screen i went once for a trivia night and it was packed and so much fun,4
this was the best theater i have been to in the valley that serves food  drinks in the movie great lobby statium seating clean and friendly service ill be back,3
the dinein theater at amc is the perfect place to take a date  with dinein experiences being 18 there are no children running around  the food is the same price as a chilis and they bring it right to your seat while you enjoy the feature  im definitely going back,3
when it comes to pizza im all about the sauce  nnbostons has great saucennthe decor its kinda generic,2
best breakfast burrito in the valley i have been here dozens of times since i have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite you will not be disappointed,4
i use to frequent this establishment a couple of times a week for a breakfast burrito however on one of my visits the gal behind the counter seemed to have pink eye  its rare that i will go there now,1
i have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality mexican food and for the price you cant beat it i recommend the rolled tacos w guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos,3
the young people in my life love this place what is wrong with the youth these days their food tastes okay for fast mexican fare however every time without fail that i have eaten here i have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later because of that i do not eat there,1
best chorizo and carne asada around forget filibertos or any of his cousins los favoritos is the bomb,4
if you want a pizza thats ready to pick up quickly this is not the place last 2 visits all i wanted was a pepperoni pizza and both times i was told a 1520 minute wait hot and ready obviously not staff isnt the nicest either,0
i loved this place the food was amazing and the portions were perfect the ambiance was good and the service impeccable i would highly recomend this place to any of my friends or family it is pricey though so make sure youre ready to shell out the dough or your corporate credit card,3
upscale environment and wonderful services the food is good but not spectacular,2
the place is nice but you do expect more especially when it has mario batalis name involved the portions are also small for the price you pay the dishes are good but you want more,1
every trip to vegas is incomplete until i end up sitting at the bar with a glass of wine savoring the superb grilled octopus,3
not goodnservice was wannabe professional and food was average at most and way overpriced had lamb for 100,0
i tried straberry waffle it was fluffy and delicious coffe was ok this is comparable with a denis if you ask meni did not expect to much from this restaurant andii liked what was served at my table,2
weve eaten here 3 times and each time had great service and food the deep fried platter for 2 is a great deal i love the inka dish with fish and cheese and rice its my favorite the selection and unique cuisine is top notch,4
awesome ceviche,4
ive had better experiences at other churrascarias the pork tenderloin and hamandpineapple selections were the only highlights,2
not entirely sure why this is 3 stars i think its delicious the meat rodizio is amazing staff was kind and funny too definitely coming back here when i go to vegas again,4
save your money i got a deal 2 people for 30 and i still felt like it was a waste of money,1
the food was awesome the meats were overwhelming the ambiance was fun definitely will return,3
not the best but certainly not the worst nnstand outs the salad bar  really   the salads were quite good and the bar also had a really great mozzarellannthe best itself wasnt the best but definitely better than averagennthe fish though the mahi mahi just wasnt up to snuff,2
been there today my dog got all exiting  thought he will meet some new friends just kids and 1 dog on a leash  im still searching for a nice  crazy  open dog park where is it just for dogs and they can run around no leash,0
its ok good for a quick bite i dont understand the almost cult like followingnmade a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hoursnstaff was very friendly but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean,1
ive been here a couple of times with my dad for dinner this place serves pretty good dish i didnt quite like the fried pork dish i can never tell if im eating fat or meat other dishes arent bad,2
we went at noon and the three lions were all sleeping,2
blood stains on wall   checknlumpy college dorm room mattress  checknasian guys giving me hard looks  checkn25 tables all weekend long  checknntwo star review  check,1
this review is for the food court it sucks the price for what you get is ridiculous ive had better burgers at mcds and for a third of the price,1
saw mike tyson hahaha sweeet,4
very nice atmosphere if you like walking around looking at casino and shopsnnhowever this place is way overpriced with 10 cocktails,1
this place is breath taking you have to go here if you go to vegasnthere is everything shopping scenery but dont forget your camera,4
all of these casinos start to run together after awhile but caesars does have one of the biggest gaming floors i remember seeing in vegasnna good a place as any on the strip to throw away your money,2
great hotel nice view of the strip from the rooms,3
everything you could need is here  yes you can venture out but why would you,4
request a room in their newer towers that were recently renovated much nicer and up to date,3
i attended a meeting at caesars in may  i had been to caesars many many times but have never stayed at the hotel  they put us up in the octavius towervery nice  big rooms comfy beds nice bathrooms and great views,3
the room or pretty decent but their wifi policy is insane  25day per device  i sucked it up and paid for my work laptop and then determined it was 25 more for my ipad and 25 more for iphone  absolutely ridiculous,0
i love it here  everyone is happy and friendly the pool was nice and relaxing i ate at 5 different places  yummy at all 5 love walking around the forum shops its just a happy place  the cons of this place is the smell of smoke  it seemed really strong i had my kids with me they had a blast,3
norton my beloved retriever loves this place and the ladies here are always happy to see him walk in the door  they have great products here carefully selected toys and treats for your dogs health  i love that its locally owned and i hope they do well,3
food was just ok nothing special about it service was ok server forgot to bring my water out for almost ten minutes until i reminded him also waited a while for the check would have been 2 stars but he made up for it at the end by trying to hold a conversation with us,2
i had the clam chowder and a dozen oysters the chowder was very creamy and thick it almost had the texture of a potato soup the bar seats around 25 or so people and there are a few tables there a good selection of dishes the oysters were sweet but on the smallish side,2
the sushi here is always fresh and delicious  not crazy about there entries there spicy tuna roll is jam packed with tasty tuna very good sushi bar,3
service at the noodle shop was good our server was very attentive servings are family style and the price is reasonable we had order the typicalnnbeef and broccoli deliciousnfried rice blandnchow mein oily and bland,2
there arent that many places open for lunch at mandalay so i was surprised that this place wasnt more crowded  there is nothing special about this place but just a quick place to drop in and get something to eat  the orange chicken was decent but nothing worth coming back for,2
this is my choice for indian food i go in for the buffet so i dont have to choose which one i want favorite would be the curie chicken,4
great food  buffet seems bigger than the one at maharajahnnproblem a cockroach ran up the wall behind my wife   waiter killed it  no manager stopped by  needless to say we paid for our meal  we never went back  a shame too   we really liked the food,1
food was almost average couldve been better had hot  wings and fries blahservice incredibly slow on a friday afternoonhad to take my tab and go find the waittress to cash outguess cant wrong with the drinks and bottled beer hereonly miller and coors on tapsports on tvs all over gives it 2 stars,1
i only ordered pho there and wasnt impressed at all but i saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good  it gave me the feeling that its a more americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn im willing to try again,2
just heard about yelp and looked up restaurants while in the phoenix area this place was amazing was there last thursday you gotta try their hummas combo been to many middle eastern places this was a treat great discovery,3
this dog park is heavily used the water feature for water dogs is really cool but it does not seem like people pick up after their dogs much boo lots of poo,2
a total waste of time no poop bags lots of poop everywhere no grass very small my dogs thought it was boring we are out of here,0
went back again and the food and price are still good,3
yes very salty its like panda express but the crab legs flow like water there and they are never overcooked plus you never really have to fight over the crab legs like other buffets  the food is good and they have lots of sushi that is endless,2
i quite enjoyed the dinner i had here and would definitely return friendly service excellent food seems on a par quality wise with bankok balcony in squirrel hill fairly small inside,3

asian pear martini it doesnt get better  we love the hummus sampler too,4
i think ive officially had my first taste of real southern bbq  this stuff was slow cooked and flavored just right  i really liked how the brisket was nice and tender  and the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat  the people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time,3
good drinks one day great drinks another watered down drinks the 3rd day thats why it got 3 stars wish i could have given it more if go back though,2
first time eating here we ordered the garlic bread balls 799 it was goodspinach artichoke dip 1499 no it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen sectionand rib eye steak 2699 like it was juicy and tender,2
unreal best bbq very good,4
this bbq is actually pretty darn good we ordered their massive samplers and and pleased to say we liked it all the meat just falls right off the ribs and the pulled pork was super tasty the atmosphere and food options kinda made it feel like we were at grandparents or something we will go again,3
disappointing while the warhol exhibit is interesting it is an extremely small display for the price wed heard about the gallery for many years and it didnt live up to the hype nnid recommend the mob exhibit at the tropicana much better value and highly recommended,1
this is an awesome venue  i came here in april to see garbage and the show was outstanding  every seat is a good one the venue is small and intimate but not too small  the drinks are a bit pricey but its vegas  the bathrooms were very clean and organized,4
i came here last night with a bunch of my bfs colleagues  they had the outside area reserved and there were bottles of tequila at the tables  yeahdrink all day by the pool followed  by drinks a party at mandalay and then add tequilannsorry liver,4
its not a nightclub its a small casino w really dimdark lighting and boring crowdmusic was good but a tiny cheapempty looking dance floorfelt like i was in a home libraryi just wanted to fall asleepanyways we left after 15 boring minutes and went to ghostbar which was way livelier,1
this is definitely the worse beach club i have been to yeah its fun on certain days when party rock makes an appearance otherwise its just an overcrowded area with a small dinky and grimy pool,1
101610nncome early to snag a spot if you can get up in timenncrowd with nice bods ready to party under the sunnncouldnt stay too long as i get claustrophobic though,2
i like almost everything about lvac except that sometime the workers are cleaning the pool area while im trying to relax in the jacuzzi i dont like water splashing around and the smell of the sanitizer  note it was not during the cleaning hours that is posted,3
i was not impressed  my catfish tasted like some aquariums smell,1
the catfish sucks is hella fishy the sides where to die for and the waters are so nice i would go agian for the sides the drinks are served in like mason jars it is the cutest thing  yams and the mac is something to get,1
i try to avoid this market unless its absolutely necessary not because the selection isnt great or because the staff isnt friendly its because its almost always overly busy,2
great asian store in bad location too many homeless in the parking lot  and by front of store begging for money or cigarettes,2
what a shit holenif you are thinking about going here  stopnthis place makes me want to take up smoking so i can subdue my appetite its dirty the food is of questionable qualitynnplease stop giving your money to this place,0
dont waste your time rude dale was a shitty bartenderserver we complained and it got us no where its true its all about who you know apparently dale knows someone id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with dale,0
great burgers waffle fries and quick service much better then i expected and they have a good dinner menu and late nite burger menu also nnplus you can play keno at your table,3
do not eat here got empanadas and they were spoiled slimy gross i was so upset drove back and got my refund i know they reuse left overs i will never ever go back youve been warned,0
this place has great food but their customer service is very lousy they were very rude to us from beginning to end especially the guy with one eye and no one seemed to care not used to that kind of service and will never go back no matter how good the food is no one should be treated like that,0
no just no my boyfriend and i came here for a late lunch he ordered a chicken bahn mi because of the good reviews here and i got a chicken noodle soup the bahn mi was dry and bland my noodle soup consisted of a tiny portions of rice noodles and rotisserie chicken wtf definitely wont return,0
dr rusick is awesome i was having chronic neck and upper back pain when one of my friends referred me to him after just a few appointments i was feeling much better  dr rusick will listen to what is bothering you and will come up with a plan to help your problem,4
dr rumman is not a helpful doctor and she doesnt answer all my questions her whole attitude at the hospital seemed arrogant and least understanding,0
located across from lowes  easy to be tempted by rays pizza just a couple doors down though  their burritos are made in front of you there and served in a large basket  portions were generous but the prices were up there to match  parking isnt bad at all because of the lowes lot,2
fun store if you are looking for korean to the poster that identified this store as japanese was wrong korean and japanese foods are similar but not the same,2
definitely one of the best if not best sushi spots in the valley its a far drive for me but well worth it to get authentic good quality tasty japanese food i will definitely be back,4
cant wait until cincinnati gets one clean quiet and ontime what more is there to say,4
its subway its probably the most food that you are going to get for 5 this subway is pretty clean and fast it helps that its in a rich neighborhood beware that it does get busy during certain hours of the daynnare there better subs most likely but not for 5,3
awesome people working there that really know their stuff great selection of guns we love arizona tactical firearms,4

there is always good stuff to find at the maxx  this store is a great way to kill an hour looking for something and end up spending 10 bucks,3
horrible customer service  i guess you shouldnt expect the cream of the crop but halfway friendly wouldnt be bad,1
been shopping  frys for years the wait  the pharmacy sucks thought since the up grade the wait would go down i was totally wrongnnand dont get me started on the rude deli people they look at you like what are you doing here,2
wish it had a drive thru but otherwise a nice location inside there is a lot of room and plenty of tables to sit and hang out there are power outlets if you look so you can also charge the computer etc while having coffee,3
we purchase our puppies 5in1 vaccines herebonus the coupon we found in the mail also applies to vaccines which add up if you are doing the whole series yourselfnnalso the various pet clubs have vet clinics for for rabies and micrchipping at dif times of the month at extremely affordable pricing,3
i would have given 4 stars but i got there at 10 when they opened and no one was home 5 minutes later an employee showed up went in and left all 4 of waiting outside for another 5 minutes the haircut was good enough id go back,2
saw positive reviews for sushi avenue and decided to stop by and try sushi avenue  the employees there are very nice and care about their customers  the food is the best  i had octapus and fresh water eel sushi as well as their teryaki chicken plate  i would deffinetly suggest going,4

good consistent food in a nice setting with good service  this is not stand out italian food but still worth checking out,2
great little italian place  very small dining area so a long wait  the food was good  the arrabiatta was actually spicy which is rare here since most places dumb it down for the general population  service was good  a solid 4 star place,3
definitely nothing to write home about generic italian food  pizza crust wasnt bad but the pastas we had were on the gummy side  also the mozzarella carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up lame,1
some stuff is cheaper other stuff is more expensive i do like the deals at the deli they have really good turkey and roast beef they also give a 10 discount on cardinals home game day if you are wearing a jersey love that they support the local team go cardinals,3
does not matter if the food is good if place is not clean  very dirty,1
the carne asada tacos are definately worth while large size corn tortilla good amount of meat a d great flavor they seen to have a good selection of other authentic mexican food will go again,3
such amazing home services i have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees residents and the owner lida beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family i wish there was 10 stars to rate them,4
i have to completely agree with justin about the quality of food from number 1 brothers it was one of the worst pizza experiences ive had and i gave them two chances the cheez is nasty and it seems like all of the toppings are either canned or jarred avoid,0
good chocolate croissants even though theyre shipped frozen and then baked at the premises  ndo they serve teas there  ill have to check that out next time im there for a croissant,2
tasty espresso very friendly  welcoming staff good atmosphere prices are competitive will definitely go back,3

ick i wanted regular bbq wings with regular bbq sauce and they put hot sauce in the bbq the vinegar  on hot wings gives me a headache so i can only eat bbq she kept trying to tell me that i wanted them medium heat i dunno not going there again i dont think at least not to eat,1
your typical buffalo wild wings franchise  tvs are placed well and no bad seat in the place  drink specials most of the time and they show most ufc and boxing ppvs,3

this place is great always friendly service and they have good facebook deals too,4
yay for local babies we got a smoking deal on a set of dwell studio baby bedding here and stocked up on clothes and a few books awesome prices and the owner was friendly and helpful well be back once the little one comes,3
similar to el torrito chain in southern california cantina laredo is fancied up mexican food at a quality restaurant price i had an appetizer cannot recall the name but had three items that was very good a nice place to go for a sit down dinner date for value i would go to habaneros,2
had breakfast here the other day with the fam great selection and to my delight many items had a greek twist to them  on top of the food being tasty you can easily share with a spouse friend relative or foe as the portions are huge  i will definitely be back soon with friends,3
longest wait times ever nobody is in the office and have been sitting here for 2 hours never again go somewhere else,0
when i moved to the area about 10 years ago this was about the only vet around and so i began to use them  i like the vet doctors  however i have had extremely poor service by the assistants and the front desk staff  and ive had enough and will no longer be using them and are now using seville,0
laid back coffee shop with friendly staff reasonable prices and great coffee what more can you ask for,4
solid mexican in a seedy part of town  its a shame that carolinas is so close otherwise i might drop by here more often,2
disappointed i got the lunch special which is a good amount of food for the price but the food wasnt worth it it wasnt hot barely even warm the enchilada sauce was too thick and i think they could try a little harder im back to going to rositas,1
too many bad experiences at this rest to count they always get my order wrong if its not that they will have someone rude at the counter they have kids running the rest skrewing things up burnt food terrible customer service stupid to eat here,0
i used to love this store but it has really gone down hill the last 3 years my last three visits to the archery counter keep getting worse and after saturdays poor service i have had enough and wont be back,0
good as home depot can be depending on your taste lowes may or may not be better for you theyre the same but different  selectionbrands that is,3
i cant find anything here i cant even find a nearby employee to help me frustrating,1
some of the worst chinese food on the planet and it is served with some attitude if you live in qc try china chef by the other frys blows this dump awaynsoggy dead food that sums this joint up,0
have to say i love this place usually order take out vs eating there but they are always very friendly when we go in   food is yummy the price is right and service is quick  would have given 5 stars if they would deliver lol,3
very clean and nice staff  probably one of the best locations they have,4
man village inn is the best  came here twice in the last two years not from the area and definitely made a point to come in on wednesday for free pie yall  seriously who can beat that  nnhad the strawberry banana french toast once and then a dinner entree another and they were all sooo gooood omg,4
i have had a hard time finding someone good to cut my hair i have tried many high end salons to no avail  so i went to fantastic sams and had lisa do my hair love it  over the top happy she actually listens to what you want  and you cant beat the price 1400  i will go back to lisa again,4
its ok the women at the desks seem to always be very busy but the 2 different optometrist that ive spoken to me have always been really nice also he pronounced my name correctly and even showed off some of his spanish speaking skills impressivenpros optometristncons front desk,2
the guy working oct 18th turned then open sign off more that 20 minutes before the 8pm close time posted  went in and asked if the store was still open and the response wad i guess i could make something  lucky we only wanted drinks  owner should be pissed,0
this is not a place i will return  they are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design they look at you like youre crazy  my designs came out absolutely horrid and i ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish,0
this place was very average ive had much better mexican food and this reminded me a lot of a chipotle but maybe a step below im not a fan and wont be back there is much better mexican food in arizona,1
amazing thin crust pizza  would be 5 star if the rest of the menu was  as good as their pizzanive been going here for 7 years or so and its always great  it has become more popular so you will likely have to wait for a table on the weekendsespecially if the snowbirds are in town,3
i used to really love this place the vermonter is the best sandwich ive ever had my only issue is that they have shrunk the size of the sandwiches and kept the price the same but the flavor is still incredible,3
ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to highend designer brands  the cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons they also have their own coupons and frequent sales so you can get good deals here,3
yeah its bbbwhat else to say,4
place was open today so it gets an extra star,2
always busy always a full parking lot be prepared to hoof itnngreat selection friendly staff,3
a great experience great driver on time  text alert for eta very reasonably priced,4
cox was great until i spoke with their customer service person juan employee 1347 all i wanted to do was take some packages off that i currently havennim paying the 15000 cancellation charge and cox can shove it,0
just horrible it taken them a month to transfer my internet over one guy i talked to was crying about him not wanting to lose his job and that he needs his job they also dont return their phone calls im glad i payed them 60 for no internet,0
worst company ever  horrible customer service not friendly  i had to walk the representative through the website over the phone  they dont care about loyalty at all or keeping customers,0
one word horrible,0

dr curry and all of his staff have been from day one professional kind and quality driven  i always love going to the dentist because dr curry and his staff make it so easy and are so personable  i have referred friend after friend to dr curry  i cannot speak more highly of a dentist,4
best mocha ever wayne makes the best drinks and is always a delight to see in the morning  i moved out of town but when i visit i stop here every morning,4
their tamales are so good i miss their breakfast burritos and street tacos as well everything is so flavorful and well seasoned its the best mexican food in mesa by far and i highly recommend it the only thing to remember is that its closed on sundays,4
no bueno i dont recommend this place its no where near authenic mexican food,0
the food was good but looked like they needed a maintenance person there was food all over the trash can the tables werent cleaned either,2
clean store and always stocked  if you cant find something they are eager to assist  there are long lines at check out but they move fast  car wash is great  always enjoy a good hot dog while there  bought a dining room table and chairs several months ago and very happy with it,4
good food and very friendly service,4
not bad at all the refried beans and rice were standouts,2
ive been a member for over 3 years but this place has really really gone downhill the trash and mess isnt cleaned up until approximately 7 am unfortunately theyre open 3 hours before that and the place is a pit i just couldnt stand it anymore,0
the hot dogs are premade and available for a hot dog buffetnnthey also sell cheesesteaks which are actually very goodnnnot fancy but good food,3
i have been here several times and they have the best cheesesteaks i was not impressed with the mexican food i ordered but the classic cheesesteak with onion is the best and dont forget onion rings,4
we went with a large group for lunch and the service was great friendly and totally cool about having separate checks the food is decent too i wouldnt say im a fan but its better than ok nncheck out their daily specials too,3
not bad  you get bar food but i think you expect that going in  nice enough ambiance for lunch  great service  the veggie burger was edible  the sweet poatoes were edible  the green tea was good  i will go again since i live so close by,2
great place in neighborhood food is excellent most meats are smoked with awesome flavorgreat happy hour for drinks and they offer their boneless wings on specialservice has been extremely slow as of late not sure why but hope it improves,3
great hang out spot in phoenix    staff is amazing and i will definitly come back next time in phoenix,4
why cant more boba places open after 9pm    lollicup is decent but not the best  a good selection boba drinks and inexpensive snack foods  my favors are the beef roll beef noodles and fried tofu if you have been to a lollicup in cali dont expect the same level of boba quality or service here,2
i would give zero stars based on service and courtesy if i could the woman in the drive thru this morning was extremely rude glad nobody was behind me because i backed out of the drive thru and am so glad i did since now im eating real food,0

i ordered the bite sized chicken pieces there was a bone in the very first one i but into it cut my gums up i am very dissatisfied avoid this place,0
my previous visits to this place left me quite unimpressed but recently there seems to have been a marked improvement in the food quality the ingredients are fresher and the food is tastier service is friendly and the place itself remains clean spacious and bright as before,3
this sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service the window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as i got to the window im not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find,1
best hangover food on the planet their macho beef burrito is fantastic i like all of their mexican items as well but the burgers and american fare is just ok nothing to talk about one way or another its clean and bright inside if you decided to dine in,3
very friendly service and a great dining experience   wr sat outside which was very nice   the pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference  and a plus  they serve coke products  and there are not too mancy choices in verado,4
i like the bookmans minichain but the book selection at this store was kind of sad there were lots of empty shelves especially in the nonfiction section maybe they need to move some books from their other stores  or offer sellers more money the north phoenix location is way better,2
visited again today  loved the new musical instrument section and the expanded sheet music area  awesome,4
bookmans is all great,3
you can always find something interesting at bookmans  my family and i like to trade in old books for store credit and pick up new books  they also have electronics games toys puzzles music instruments etc  nnit is a great way to declutter your home,3
dated but nice  good chicago hot dogs and they sell old style beer  cant beat that,2
slowest rental car check in ever took over an hour and i wasnt even sure what the hold up was as there was not a big line at all,0
i always prefer to support the local businesses but subway is better,2
much cleaner and nicer location than 15th ave  bethany home rd employees are friendlier and more willing to help here it seems bigger store with slightly larger selection also,3
they dont have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform no great and they are mean when attend to you i recommend the service at jersey mikes better,0
this is the best place to get maxi dresses it might be pricier than other places but the quality and fit are way superior i have invested in 1 dress each summer and they are by far my favorite dresses and i get a ton of compliments when i wear them i dont see other girls wearing the same ones either,4
pretty decent compared to other places in the area a lot better than the one by grand  reems i will come here again,2

the guy overcharged my sister for sure pizza was mediocre im from ny and i know what good pizza tastes like,0
horchata is delish familiar faces is nice pretty good veggie burrito bomb breakfast burrito seriously good decent prices but their guacamole could use some work,2

its a laid back place for sure with all the plusses and minuses that go with that crackerjack superfast service dont count on it dusty in the corners seems to fly on auto pilot a lot in any case its the bar i go to the most so go figure nothing quite like it,3
weve ordered from slide and bounce around a couple of times we love what they offer and had a blast every time,4
always someone or something wanting a hand out this place smells in the early mornings,1
the location is perfect next doors to our dentist and i think their chicken is awesome the spicy honey mustard and asiago parmesan also must try their homemade asiago chips nice,3
its a really good crowd there and the food is better than just pub grub i give them two stars because the place is posted no firearms and you can no longer smoke on the patio if those are of no concern to you then you will like the place just fine im going to the gym,1
i really dislike it when i go to a resturant and do not get acknowledged 10 min is just too long  then to serve tepid beer and not offer a glass  not goodnot good,0
can i tell you how much i love this nail place they all do an amazing job on my nails every time i am in there i go every two weeks n they really are the best perfection every time and every nail tech is so so good ive been going there for about 6 months n every time is perfect,4
they are remodeling the place its gigantic but a little messy,2
if your not in a hurry this might be the starbucks to go to i have never been to a slower starbucks its not that its even that busy the staff just seems to be hungover i go here just about every sunday because its close but i think from now on i will be driving by and heading to another,0

just came back from there ordered two for five two fries nugget specialno nuggets i was the only one in drive thru i worked for bk fifteen yrs but really we got the sauce though my manager wouldve been pod  thanks amanda the cashier and whoever expidited the order,0

we just bought a house with an evaporative cooler on it in mesa  the previous owners said that the building of tempe town lake cut 3 months off of the time they could use the coolers due to the humidity being raised  nnalso the dam has popped so there is no lake at the moment  thats a negative,1
came because they claim to cut high tech auto keys not only did i not get a key cut but i was told they could not cut the key for my honda if you are going to advertise that you cut high tech keys then you should be able to,0
went for breakfast and the food was tasty the service was just average the eggs benedict were tasty but very salty without a lot of character the egg white and veggie omelette was ok but nothing spectacular the dining room is clean large and fun i would go back but the food is nothing spectacular,2
this is most certainly not a frys marketplace frys marketplaces sell all of the home goods this one is definitely not one i just walked in and all of the floors are ripped up tres sanitary plus its dingy and small blech,0
we loved this beautiful museum with friendly staff  get the free headsets to learn more details  it had a great balance of local history with more contemporary art  we saw some new just new to us techniques and mediums like casein paint egg tempera etc very nice little gift shop,4
i love their burritos and could eat them daily if i didnt have to worry about weighing 400 lbs the problem with this place is the parking stinks and if you go at a busy time lunch it is packed and isnt quick to get in and out this keeps me from going as often as i would like,2
employees are really loud and very rude while in break is there a reason why 3 of them are yelling and laughing hysterically and manage to be louder then all 20 ppl sitting and eating in the dining room,2

i wish there was less than 1 star because now that they dont have flour chips there is no point it is just another mexican restaurant  super bummer,0
i may not be back like previously statednnthe last two times i got take out food the chips tasted like they had been cooked in rancid oil and the salsa was waaay too salty it pains me to say this place has really gone downhill from what it once was i havent been back in a long time,1
food is ok service is ok crab legs are just the same with crazy buffet dinner at 16head adult quite pricey,2
very sad food quality here  the yoshi in central phoenix is phenomenal but this airport location is nor worth anyones time,0

most people seem to like it but not me  it was not bad just did not seem that special to me,1
the atmosphere is nice and modern and you can smell all of the yummy chinese food when you walk in i especially love the beef chow mein the only thing i havent liked is the fried rice which just seems like white rice with veggies and meat thrown in great place for takeout,3
the food is just okay i have had better service is slow,1
very very happy with integrity auto glass i called them and they got my insurance on the line and my windshield was replaced  within 48 hours very professional service from the installer steve highly recommend,4

great service last thursday when i was holiday shopping the shoes i wanted were not in stock but they offered to mail them to me free of charge they said they couldnt guarantee they would arrive by christmas but friday evening at 6pm there was a knock at my door and they were delivered amazing,4
so first the lady on the phone read my order back completely wrong i corrected her twice and when i arrived in 30 min to pick them up i had to wait another 10 the order was still in correct and nothing was offered in return i love nypd but not this one and i advise to go to another location,0
i went in to buy a center cut filet wrapped with bacon they sold me what i thought was that but turned out to be end cuts pressed together when i called in the guy i talked to was unapologetic acting like it wasnt his problem f you guys you just lost a customer,0

just ok i got the food to go and i thought it was very over priced for what we got dont think ill go back,1
bready bagels not real bagels egg sandwich is terrible  the egg tasted like dishwaternnthis place makes einstiens bagels seem like geniuses  and im no fan of chainstore bagelsnnstick with chompies or back east bagels in tempe for something more bagellike and a good breakfast sandwich,0
excellent place to grab a bagel and cup of coffee i have been going there for years it is a pleasure to be greeted by name keep up the great job,4
i work downtown and chloes is by far my favorite every salad is amazing and the food is very fast so its great when your in a rush i prefer to make my own salad and enjoy the fresh ingredients but when i have ordered from the menu i have never been disappointed,4
we caught quite a few fish but the guide was pretty rude and full of himself   acted like it was a privilege for us to be fishing with himnwont be going back   dont need an attitude on what should be a relaxing fish trip,1
its quite simple the food is great the service is slow and 989 of the time they will get your order wrong,1

i tried a slice of lemon cake it tasted very artificialkind of pinesolish definitely not homemade i also tried a few cookies that were ok nothing to get too excited about,1
no matter if its a good or bad experience my husband and i alway find ourselves talking about what a good manager this location has he is always open to help his employees not sure of his name but he is tall and slim kudos sr we the regulars to this location notice everything,3
absolutely the worst customer service you can imagine  the only thing keeping verizon in business is the good coverage and overpriced calling plans,0
this place was so busy when we walked in that we ended up waiting an hour and a half before we got helped  besides the waiting thoughthe staff was very friendly and helped with any questions we had  nthey might want to staff a little better but in all my verizon experience was ok,2
prosnthey showed up on timennconsnthey took 525 hours to load my pods i did 95 of the packing before hand it should have taken them 3 hours to do that work and they charged me 446 in materials  so todays damage was 1150 buyer beware,1
i love my doctor but i hate waiting every time i come here n today im getting my blood test done which i cant make an appointment for n couldnt eat anything before i came in they r making me wait because its her lunch timereally,0
terrible prices and service  their yorkies start at 3k  they are out of their mind,0
usually quick haircuts are a bit iffy i think a couple of their stylists are a bit rude you get the service you pay for for the price see fabian next door at the canyon salon for a 5 haircut for kids he actually did a superb job for half the price,1
i didnt have a room here just came to gambledrink southpoint is nice refresher to keep away from the crowds and people from the strip mostly local people here and i like how they are quick with the beers at the video poker at the center bar i will definitely come back here,3
roomy modern rooms and fun pool and hot tub great alternative to smoky old strip hotels moderately price,3
dont count on a rollaway for your family they have a self imposed policy of 2 beds to a room and will not change no matter the circumstances expectations or that they advertise rollaways available,0
one of the south points best keep secrets is its mens barber shopni have been going there for over 6 yearsnexcellent haircuts and shaves at reasonable pricesnalthough they can accommodate walk ins i strongly recommend you make annappointment,4
nice room and the bowling alley was coolnnbig minus for the morning shuttle leaving earlier than scheduled and the front desk denying the fact we were outside by 9am but the shuttle was already gone be prepared to pay cab fare nnjust do not rely on the hotel shuttle service,1
dont go here for food unless you want to wait in lines forever  every restaurant or deli has the longest and slowest functioning lines,1
i just checked in a a couple of hours and i want to check out im used to customer service and from the bell stand front desk and housekeeping its the worsesmh,1
i came back and doreen helped us at the bar she was great she made conversation and encouraged me to try the siracha wings which were amazing,4
high prices bad neighbourhood food tastes good but with the money i spent could of want to the buffet instead,1
beautiful decor they gave us some free champagne since were there for our honeymoon the tasting menu is very decadent with caviar and truffles if you like sushi this is the place to go,4
i love giant clam this place always has it fresh and crunchyndont let them seat you in the front area where you walk in sit in the back by the windows  the view is great  ni minus 1 star for the price here  even with my local discount,3
roku is to sushi as the golden child is to eddie murphy movies  far closer to the bottom than the topnroll selection was weak and construction was worse having said that their crab dynamite was delicious,1
thought the place was decent liked the shima roll everything else was good but did not have the wow factor working for them,2
fun sushi spot i try to hit everytime im in vegas  if you like sushi give this place a try,3
we sat at the sushi bar and were well entertained by the master sushi chefs therenthe sushi and sashimi was just so fresh expertly cut and well presentedni enjoyed it so much i just had to try the toro which was exceptionalnthis is up there with nobu and morimoto as far as i am concerned,4
excellent staff food service quality freshness delish excellent prices,4
great sushi fresh fish their toro was particularly good did not like their hanabi everything else tasted amazing,3
always amazingwe started with miso soup then the shishito peppers yum and then bluefin tuna and japanese mackerel sushi then a roboto skewer of filet wrapped around fois gras and asparagus  next a spicy yellowtail nigiri sushi plus uni and masago  perfect balance great view romantic yum,3

was waiting their with my boyfriend for almost 10 minutes until we got seated the place was empty the hostess didnt even bring me a menu we just walked out worst ihop ever,0
ive been coming here with my wife for a couple of years and this place has been little by little getting worse with their equipment chairs and foot tubs the pedicures are awsome however its no long a relaxing experience  i ill start looking for a more relaxing place for my wife and i,1
friendly staff clean bathroom atm worked cheap drinks in comparison to other places in the area  ill be back often,4
the rude staff i have meet first it took them a minutes to sit me and my son after being seated my son and i waiting over 20 minutes no drink no service the whole time i am just looking around eating to be service and no they was not business at all bs,0
awesome place large selection in golf clubs and tennis gear pretty good deals that i liked bill stauffer helped me and he was very knowledgable you can get custom fitted for your clubs and they will order them for you very friendly and professional place,4
when scheduling for your cleaning ask for miss julia shes great,4
sage is  now under new management food portions are small and prices have gone up,0
filthy line you would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchenline sense it is visible its makes you question the sanitation i wont be coming back,0
nothing special free internet but connectivity is sporadic at times and capable bandwidth is limited due to nontrunking cheap servicensandwiches are aboveaverage priced for a below average portionsandwichcontentncustomer service is top level in the industry,2
the service was extremely unprofessional and our order was missing several items the food quality was still good but no one seemed to know what they were doing,1
bad service got both of my coffee orders wrong and my food order lady was rude on the intercom and they took 20 min this is just another reason why starbucks does so well always great customer service and your order is always right maybe this place should learn a few things from them,0
im not sure i get the appeal of this place  its like main street in disneyland only it has a pottery barnnnpeople seem to like to bring their dogs here and it seems to be a community gathering place for green valley  but id rather hang out somewhere a little more urban,2
we ordered the 44 magnum with the extra shot and 12 yard between my honey and i we were definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol by the time we made it back out to the street well worth the 12 unfortunately ive got a horrid headache now at 7pm from all the cheap liquor from today,3
they were great synthetic oil change the cheapest ive seen in town their alignment machine was occupied so instead of holding my car hostage and trapping me they did the paperwork and payment for the oil change and said theyd call when it was open,3
i get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager michael jorgensen  he is polite articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life  i always enjoy our brief chats,4
dont come here didnt get the order right and there was a bug in the bag that fell on our table yes a bug still alive and everything and no it didnt come from our apartment it came from inside the bag im saving yall a trip,0
loved the warm garlic bread with gorgonzola fondue yummy ntheir porterhouse with bakedmashed potatoes was the bombnnalthough it is pricey the food is excellent,4
steak was overcooked appetizers never came out and they screwed up my drinknnhave eaten at other strip houses and this one was by far and away the worst one of the bunchnnside notewe think that our waiter may have been high on something but he didnt offer to share,0
great meal started with the seafood plateau and finished with the filet they nailed it,4
rubios is amazing  their fish tacos were so delicious  i almost couldnt believe they were from a chain,3
their food is fine their prices are too high for what you get i wont go out of my way to eat there but if ill be in the neighborhood and  have the craving for this kind of food ill eat there again,2
great discounted price they have a wide selection of raybans i wished they had more dgs though and a separate section for men sheryl was very patient with me she knew the style i wanted the moment i described to her the look i was going for got my new glasses in 15 hours,4
tina marie is amazing she was so helpful and i really enjoyed my shopping experience with her she was very thorough and explained everything to me along each step of the process i cant wait to get my new glasses,4
excellent service no problems free upgrade and one of the sales associates took me home when she got off work  if i need to rent another car i will definitely come here again,4
dont go there the most horrible experience ever they altered my jeans to the point that i cannot wear it or return them they were very rude and when i asked for my money back i didnt got the full price i paid and the money was thrown to me,0
you may think otherwise but i actually have a limit for enjoying things ironically and this is pretty much it,2
thats it  dont even bothernnthe casinos here do offer better pay  we found full pay jacks or better machines at the four queens  but you have to suffer through the slummiest of skank old school casinos  probably not worth itnnwont be heading back downtown on future trips,0
you never know what you will see on fremont st the place for a cheep show from the man in the box to the guy painting with spray paint to the guy doing clay sculpture while you wait also you may see jesus the light show if pretty cool to,4

wanted to start off day with a good meal dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before the food was fresh the service amazing thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day,4
for being a local hang out  this place has the coldest draft beer around and the nachos and wings  arent too shabby either  unfortunately this place has the most unfriendliest waitresses around the minute you step in you are greeted by  a long face gal that can just sour the rest of your nite,1

loved the family atmosphere and home cooked food  the owners moved from ny to las vegas years ago and brought their yummy italian recipes with them  the lasagna pizza and prepackaged tiramisu were great  only a short drive from the strip and well worth the cheaper home cooked food,3
its subwaytastes the same everywhere you goat least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick nuff said,1

i love sterling period i do think however the bagels at 095 are a bit pricey but they are greatnot ny but as close as you can get,4
solid kabob place absolutely zero decor in the place but its huge an cheap which is great for big parties,2
ive been here twice and the food is great but what makes this place even better is the service they go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful very clean restaurant friendly staff and great food this one is great to revisit,3
it could have all 5 stars if the service was better food is very good most of the times but yesterday my pork kebob had way to many bones they made me wait for my drink and then for my sauce so if you like your food without soda and ketchup go for this place,2
great portions good prices and excellent service the ambience is friendly and the music is relaxing great place to go on a date or with family we come every time we are in vegas,4
the service sucks the entrances are weird and confusing employees look angry and unapproachable they do make good hummus pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and i would rather go elsewhere,1
very nice ambiance and service is really nice the food pretty normal although i think their babaganoush is perfect here not overly tangy and the meats are cooked perfectly,3
was in the area and looking for guacamole mix so i stopped in here to see if i could find some  unfortunately they didnt have any so i left and went to the vons on lake mead  buffalonnthe store was clean but the parking lot is a disasternnreturn factor  33,2
best gyro we ever had worth the drive,4
decent course for the 45 off season price greens were in terrible shape but im told they are better during the summer be sure to practice good etiqueccy here and watch out for the dbag wearing all black,2

i recently had a quick bite to eat at this location  my usualbean burrito and 7 layer burritonnorder was accuratennplace was cleannnfood was oknnits taco bellnot much to saynnwill i return  sure,2
the service is either hit or miss,1
big mall with all the good shops just like down in htown hollister and abercrombie they even have the abc store you can buy like chips drinks and shirts and hats here the mall is nice and the convenience  that it was within walking distance of my hotel,3
with over 200 different major stores they have great dining a huge outdoor mega screen and lots of events including daily fashion shows,3
its one of the larger more traditional big city type malls in vegas lots of department stores and tons of stores nothing too fantastic but it is worth checking out if you are looking for the normal shopping in vegas,3
typical mall but a bit over priced and not geared towards locals definetly a tourist trap mall but still has a few nice specialty shops and occasionally a good sale here or there the coffee bean here is awesome and the mall has free yoga on sundays at lululemon so thats a plus as well,2
great mall need more elevators more restrooms and what the hell says you open at 1000 am but the stores arent even open yet nnthis mall needs to get it together,3
great service  food tasted great too,4
the tea is ahhhmazing i was drinking so fast i nearly choked lol its quality tea the chicken fingers were yummy i put la hotsauce in my canes sauce and it was mouth watering the fries were not fresh but im not much of a crinkle fries fan,3
val was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products she helped me with a sim card issue and didnt even charge me so i bought a stock charger for a great price will buy from again and refer my friends and family,4
where else can you catch a sporting event or concert for less than 20  with lots of parking and reasonably priced food and drinks this is the place to be to watch all your favorite artists that are not headliners on the strip  i just recently watched the swv and joe concert it was well worth it,3
mojitos  enough said,4
nice selection of cigars and a sophisticated wide ranging bar and cocktail menu mojitos are very authenticnodd comment for a cigar bar but we found it a little too smoky late at night,3
nice selection of fuente cigars including some very exclusive lines knowledgeable and friendly staff reasonable not cheap cigars topoftheline cigars for the most part and finally a very nice lounge nice to see a classy cigarbar to enjoy while my wife shops a winwin,4
drspellman is great i felt no pain during a filing and felt very comfortable im not a fan of dentists but he made me feel comfortable,4
we took a nice tour of las vegas with this cab company one that we didnt want instead of going right to the wynn we went down by mandalay bay and then onto the highway and back up northnnavoid this cab company unless you want to pay for a tour of the strip,0
food here is satisfactory its not going to blow your mind i generally order the california burrito and its good but if your looking for something authentic look elsewhere however it does the job if your looking for something cheap and filling,2
after trying the sundance special for the very first time i try so hard to try other items on the menu but i seem to always revert back to my sundance special love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast,4

its 106 degrees outside and 90 plus inside the restaurant  asked if the ac was on oh yes she would check  its 90 plus ac is not working daaahh,0
customer service here is terrible  the teenage asian girl there never has a clue to anything please hire someone with more common sense and a better personality and maybe youll have more happy customers,1
over priced grumpy driver i could get 2 subs at jimmy johns for the price they charged me the dessert cheese cake sub parrthick bread hardly any meat i do not recommend it,1
love it  i like that they do half sushi rolls  the best rolls are the ocean roll sexy roll and first kiss  and their ice cream in your mouth is a very neat dessert roll  their ayce price cannot be beat it includes everything on their menu,4
try the soondubu jjigae and bibimbap every meal comes with 6 korean side dishes so i always leave satisfied the waitresses here are very kind helpful and smiley one of them even helped me with my korean which i greatly appreciated i highly recommend you try this place out,4
the worst bbq ever seen servers are fine but the best rice is really really extremely expensive specialty the beef stew dont ever come here,0
overburned rockhard rice in their dolsot bibimbap almost broke my teeth terrible dining experience here,0
me and my friends chill here twice a week nader is the best bartender around great music lots of tvs and great food i love this place,4
the place is hit or miss depending on which bartender you get  they have some really good ones but they also have at least 1 really bad one  i wont name names but i wouldnt recommend the place on certain nights of the week,1
good variety really good prizes service could be better sales people are really not interested in helping you find the right jeans model but are at least smiling,2
if you like waiting then this is the company for you  the people are fine but forget about punctuality its not here  take a cab and save some time,1
spend a little more and take a taxi just rude tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away we knew more about the events going on than they did no accountability,0
never again if youre trying to reschedule a hotel pick up youre wasting your time and your money customer service sucks you would do better to take the public bus system not only is it easier and more direct its a lot more inexpensive,0
holy moses best chicken cheesesteak ive ever had i highly recommend this place,4
delicious sub i love how the turkey is shredded  tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor  my only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much  if the dressing had been on the meat it would have been perfect  way better than subway,3
cobra kai is the best gym i ever went to sim is the best jiujitsu coach in the world i recommend this gym,4
the food is cook fresh and it taste delicious the prices are really reasonable,3
worst service of my life slow service wasnt busy at all got cold bread around the same time my pizza came out save your money and go elsewhere,0
always love going to cpk there three of us the salad and spaghetti was excellent took awhile to get served bread and a waitress she was looking right through me as i recited my order was slow and just not interested id still go back though,2
nice prices horrible customer service ill only be back because they have really cute stuff,1
this place is off the strip so the prices are better here  has everything you need to take to the hotel  local types here and friendly service  not a lot of transients hanging around like other places in the area,2
i stopped going to this location there is always someone waiting outside to ask for money cigarettes a cell phone call etc this store is on my way to work i used to stop here at least twice a week then i got tired of the vagrants beggars and drug addicts harassing me,0
the ultimately slowest sbux everthey seem to have plenty of employees but the speed just isnt there isnt starbucks supposed to be convenient,0
was not thrilled by the massage or the way that they try to railroad you into a contract i did not like either one  they pretend to be the premier place to go but truthfully they are subpar   i viewed them as used car salesmen,1
great place i love my nails and toes will come back again prices are reasonable and everyone is friendly and courteous,4
i love outback the steaks are great and a lot less pricey then the hotel steakhouses  the wait staff hostesses and management are awesome,4
i went in for and met the dr very very briefly we decided not to do anything i still got a bill i dont recommend going here,0
had a mole removed over a month ago and have yet to hear from them with the results,0
every time i have used desert taxi they have been so nice on the phone when i order a taxi and the driver has always showed up early in fact if i wasnt ready they always said take your time,4
terrible service they were rude over the intercom didnt listen and hung up on us before we were finished never had such a hard time at a drive through the food was ok but just average most likely not returning,1
great apps elham is a fantastic server ask for her if you go but you shouldnt everything else was horrible just go next store to dw bistro instead,0
was close by for a doctors appointment and yelp introduced me to this place  i fell in love with the place exceptional food and service one of the best meals i have ever had in my life,4
this place has some if the best italian food ive ever had our waitress was terrific the drinks were delicious the food was phenomenal and the view isnt so bad either,4
small portions  expensive waiter didnt seem to know much about the menu or drinks my specialty drink was suppose to have candy in it it didnt lasagna was tiny pizza was okay i didnt mind it nothing special tho,2
the bread is the only thing delicious here service was poor cesar salad taste rotten fettuccine chicken was bland,0
it was a little disorganized the staff was super friendly though the lady that checked me out was efficiently quick and cheerful the sales were great today as well,3
owner is a profit driven douchebag hey nothing wrong with hustling but he hustles in a rude thoughtless wayasked him to start carrying  sage incents every time i go in and he refuses to even acknowledge the request,0
fast  good,4
needed to have my phone repaired todaychecked in at 330wasnt helped until 503  this is the same case scenario everytime i have to go inwhich is a lot because my phone blows,0
went because friends that were in town wanted to see him and he was great  loved the finale  worth the   just dont stay at luxor,3
a show you can count on for some great laughs  carrot top has tons of funny props and sound effects  i would recommend it,2
i didnt think i liked carrot top but after seeing great reviews decided to see his show  i am so glad i did  it was hilarious  a must see in vegas,4
great show half the cost of other shows and as most reviews have already said ndo it not a bad seat in the house is also true perfect view as rows are low enoughnthat your not looking at the back of someones head,3
we had the best thanksgiving dinner at arizona charlies buffet  fabulous stuffing real mashed potatoe great desserts  no mess to clean up at home  thank you for working on this holiday and for making such good food,4
i love the red rock casino but the kids have ruined this theater  if you must go dont look down  the carpets are gross and really need a change  otherwise they always have a good selection of movies an imax theatre and they even have a party room if youd like to throw one there,0
we only go to this theater to see movies its always clean the staff is friendly the concessions are good soda mixed perfect every time the theater seating is comfortable and spacious nnin five years we have never had a bad experience at this theater,4
they need to hire a receptionist who is willing to give business to their salon and stylist i just got off the phone with the worst receptionist of all time who had no clue on how to run a salon talking my business elsewhere,0
walked in at 115am august 10 2014  walked out 130 a waitress touched pancakes with her dirty ass hands after she rang up seven people at the cash register   serve the pancakes cold as well,0
agree with all previous reviews this company is one of the worst i have ever dealt withperiod it was literally so bad i felt like i was on some blooper punked show avoid them or suffer,0
apm is a complete joke  dont waste your time listing your investment property with themi will let the countless horrible reviews speak for themselves and not waste my time writing all the garbage i want to write about them,0
i wish i  could give it less  they used to be good  the owner was a jerk on the phone,0
i decided to try this place after reading reviews on yelp the service was great they make sure to pay attention to little things like calling you by name after you sign in i love that they dont try and do manicures and pedicures at the same time in an effort to rush you through,3
ridiculous prices  not all that tasty  not for downtoearth types,2
a lovely bunch of bones comes with each choco box during hawlowene if chocolate could talk it would saw buauahahaha spooooky,4
sooo good great price good portions this may be my favorite place for hearty meals such good hearty food choices i actually thought this was a mexican restaurant im not disappointed it wasnt yummy,4
way way way too expensive for the products being offered  there are other locations around town with much much better dealsnhowever it does have shelf after shelf of items to look at as you walk through it borders on sensory overload,1
the food was good  the service at this location is horrible they are slow never check in with your table and take forever to bring something once you ask for it never coming back to this location going back to the one on di their service is amazing and the atmosphere is so much nicer,0
majestic cabinets refinished the cabinets in my entire house they did an amazing job and the price was very reasonable as well they were flexible as well when i changed my mind on color in the kitchen they also have several other references that you can call that all recommend this company,4
the employees are sooo rude here i asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response i got was no chocolate shake thats not even a complete sentenceand they want to make 15hr ridiculous,0
its a fun bar with great food and a good atmosphere   awesome tvs  great place for a pit stop or a party,3
as far as gas stations go this is one of my favorites do to location prices and food yes food well gas station food that is lol prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine hot dogs taquitos sandwiches with mystery meat etc,3
i am so dissappointed that pf changs has removed the salt  pepper prawns from the menu my husband and i went there specifically  for this entree too bad not sure if we will return we usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp i guess we can get orange chicken anywhere,1
try the pan fried dumplings,3
worst service ever dispatchers are rude and cabs have a tendency to no show,0
best stone crab ever nnwe went for a late dinner and had the stone crab bisque which is just incredible the onion strings and the 5 large stone crab meal and dont forget all the great bread our server was stephen who was always available nnwe are definitely coming back soon,3
not sure why this place gets such great reviews the service was good but the food just ok and the locationatmosphere okni found the price very expensive as wellnnot worth it,1
in heaven every time i step foot in this restaurant i cant say enough about joes seafood and i cant think of one entree that i havent loved great lunch menu as well and the seafood salad is to die for,4
came here because of the reviews had high expectation and we waited about 20 mins to be seated but honestly the red lobster cooked better seafood the grilled shrimps were very dry our server disappeared after we got our food took forever to ask for our bill,1
g approved my food god this is the best seafood joint around the crab stone is a must have also the seafood fried platterget it wine was great and the service was excellentnnyeacant go wrong at all prepare for a nap afterwards,4
very fair  went with waiters recs  shouldnt have joes in florida so much better,2
very nice meal  the lobster bisque is really to die for  the lobster surf n turf is the business  i also had an order of crab legs with the filet however not as tasty as the lobster for sure  wonderful restaurant loved the layout and decor,3
some good rolls a lot of choice  ill go again for sure,2
this club is really cool great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her cheap to get in elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up the view from the club itself is amazing drinks are pricey but well made and strong must check it out,4
pricey but heyits vegasngreat drinks  theyre strong and yummyngood selection of songs and nice variety nlove the viewnnps check out the bathroom,4
bar is amazing  the restaurant was sub par for the prices  i ordered the peppercorn filet and it was encrusted with whole peppercorns which made it inedible  it should have been stellar for that price point,2
the food was great the view is phenomenal,3
i just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that id love to come back fro drinks and food the view is amazing on par with ghostbar good music sexy vibe,2
we have been here 3 times and the service has been bad every time the view is amazing but because of the poor service we will not return,1
this is by far and away the finest greek food i have ever had  thank god i found this place as i will be eating there often  fantastic flavors portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful,4
i have been coming here for several years and have always had a good experience this is a family owned business and they all work very hard to make it a great place,4
you definetly get your fill for the price the flavors here are good but not great definetly worth it if you have a craving for mediterranean and dont want to fix it at home not bad though will give it another shot when i get another craving lol,3
this place is great  great food and a great value  the gyro and chicken plate are out of this world,4

customer service is very bad i wanted to return dog toy which is i never opened  they were so lazy to do it  i gauss they were mad to me i dont know,0
im sure for tourists this place would be okay but theres better mexicanmargarita joints out there its touristly convenient yea but i would go somewhere else nnchips and salsa were good but how can anyone mess that up other than that nothing really stood out,1
rude thats all i have to stay about the staff and service at this branch,0
while visiting with family in las vegas we decided to have breakfast at mimis since my uncle recommended it we were not disappointed the food and service were great the pumpkin spice pancakes were awesome,4
this location closes early and on the night i visited they were closed before their posted time,0
for a place to have good drinks play pool and chill this is the place to go never really super busy so service is always pretty good bluemoon always cold and fresh,4
this review is for just the restaurantnni would have given higher but you could smell smoke from the bar areannthe food was pretty goodnni had the sirloin  vegetables and baked potato everything tasted good the service was also good,2

its mcdonalds not a class establishment to begin with this one was a little dirty and not efficient with its service waited a very long time for food during a not so busy time,1
i ate here on dec 12 2013 and got food poisoning  i was sick for 2 days  friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests,0
absolutely love this place i work in the same parking lot in which they are located and after learning they have vegetarian options on their menu i decided to give it a try their food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is always so sweet,4
steves communication and professionalism is exceptional i had a dent that the dealer and dent pros said could not fixed but steve was able to do it nnsteve was good at setting expectations and estimating price nnif i ever get another dent this will be where i go,4
worst mcdonalds by far it always smells like sewage and the food is alway old when you tell someone about its like an inconvenience to them i cant believe the manager is actually the manager she has the personality of a rock there are only a small amount of great employees here,0
i reserved a non smoking room and they messed up with that  i ended up getting a smoking room and that was so gross,1
mel is without a doubt the best hard working person there ill go back everyday just to receive her amazing customer service,4
i love starbucks and i love coffee but here my caramel macchiato shot was burnt and bitter the two times i have been here so far the only starbucks that screwed up my drink i rather just go down the road and find another one a few blocks away,0
were here because pictures on yelp looked amazing but going in person was a whole other experience service was bad and fish was not fresh would never go again,1
if you are desperate and have no where else to turn this come close to chinese food i suggest going 2 china one in the smith shipping center way better food for similar prices actually i am holding back a bit call me a snob but panda is horrible,1
worst nail salon in summerlin do not go here they will tell you they can do what you want and then they dont do it and try to charge your more than quoted this place is a joke,0

i know and love la area pastrami and this place is ok for the high prices the over price burgers are ok  they have coke products advertised on menu but only carry pepsi products i will not be returning i will save my cravings for when i go visit la,1
best place in vegas al was a big help  made it so convenient  it was at a great price and got it the next day  i wont go anywhere else for my banners this is the place to go great prices great quality and no shipping cost,4

china joes chinese takeout not bad but nothing specialnnchicken was goodrice was goodegg rolls were good but it needed some msg or something a little bland for my tastennfeed a family of 4 for 30 the ribs i will pass on next time,1
i agree that its not bad and for a starving college student like myself you cant beat the price ni had the general chaos chicken meal deal thingy they give you a lot of food for cheap and its not bad mannnn 545nso if youre in the hood aka unlv lookin for somethin good try china joes,2
a fun stop on a vegas excursion  staff was friendly and patient with a group of newbs  i chose the glock tommy gun and desert eagle 50 cal  desert eagle is a monster  a worthwhile stop when youre in vegas,3
hey guys i am a manager for discount tire i had my car serviced at gils there isnt a more honest friendly place to go to for all your auto needsask for gil or jameson im glad i found a place with honesty and integrity it is far a few these daysgive them try you wont regret it,4
slowest starbucks ive been to unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where i live but the drive through always takes 1015 minutes whether theres 2 people in line or 12  people very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick starbucks is elsewhere,1
drive thru is super slow no one in front of us had an order more than 2 drinks they need to get it together go to the starbucks down the street inside the smiths on windmill and rainbow,1
go to other radio shack this radio shack its ok but other ones are better,0
poor customer service they completely suck they ruin your drinks and ruin your experience of going to starbucks,0
called from walmart to get picked up with all my shit i had milk etc and i had to wait outside for almost 2hrs fuckin ridiculous  annoying they should at least advise a very long wait then i wouldnt of even checked out to begin w cause my food just ended up spoiled by the time i got home ugh,0
paid for a venti green tea lemonade and got a tall green tea lemonade  reason why i didnt go back was because i had to go to school was in a rush i wish the girls that always take my orders were there,2
this is the most dishonest company nnthe  technician opened up my unit and put to wires together and shorted it out nhe thought i wouldnt notice but hard not to when the wires sparkednhe denied doing it but i saw i it myselfni was  confirmed with nevada power when they came,0
um scaryi live really close and only venture in for emergency sports betssuper smokey and crap food skip it and drive to aliante if in the area,1
this is the only place i go for delicious frozen treats i recommend this awesome place to everyone plus i dont deviate from the vanilla custard because its all i ever crave,4
i dont think frozen custard is my kind of thing i probably wouldnt drive all the way out here for it thats not to say theyre bad since i only had the chocolate frozen custard on a cone thats all nnwasnt really into trying the other stuff but maybe im just too used to ice cream and froyo,2
wasnt impressed sorry delivery was timely delivery guy was very nice but food wasnt good,1
this place isnt all that maybe its cause i went in there to early in the day  didnt really look like a great place to party or waste a lot of time in although it did have a nice irish look but i still wont go back,1
im not a big club person so i heard there was an irish pub in vegas i was there on my first night good selection of irish beer we had huge chicken pot pies served in a pail soooo good,3
we had such a good night here  great atmosphere fantastic band who took requests from the floor a really good irish dancer and far too much guinness a bit pricey but it is vegas we stayed for 4 hours till closing time,4
nice irish bar but crazy expensive worth a visit for a beer and then punch out they usually have decent live music,1
9 for a tap beer come onnwaited forever for our food  after half an hour we paid for our drinks and leftnimpossible to get a table  unclear if it was seat yourself or if we just find our own placeni love irish pubs and was very disappointed with this one,1
wonderful place to eat dinner in vegas  we had a delightful dinner here with live music in the background  we had to wait to get seated but totally worth it  very enjoyable meal,4
the names of the dishes and looks may fool you but there is no meat here which is great if your a true vegan or vegetarian i also love the taro slush i get one every time with no boba vegan style uses soy milk,3
veggie delight very great cooking and good flavor foods fresh and cleanni love it,4
i love this place when i first moved to las vegas it was one of the only places i knew of to get vegan food took my son back today and he went crazy for his chicken sandwich and banana slush still as great as i remember,3
i dont typically eat here but my wife likes the slushies they offer,1
happy hour from 25pm for slushies and 8midnight for shakes,4
ive been to this location a few times its just ok two other favorite location are on cheyenne and buffalo as well as the flamingo and arville location the half off shakes any time after 8pm is superb gotta love their banana ice cream shakes,4
my husband recieved an mildewed potato we told the staff the manager was no where to be found be careful eeekkkkk,0
i had a super rude cashier made a huge fuss over a exchange of a broken item i would have bought but because of her rudeness i did my exchange and left i didnt get her name but on my receipt it says cashier 1271421,1
food is too expensive the quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices the staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs the worst panda express ive ever been to,0
food is great but terrible service,2
very impressed  learned a lot about how i run and which type of shoes will help my feet stay happy  very friendly and great customer service also priced well  nice couple who are runners own the store so go there and support a local small business,4
worst chinese chicken salad i ever had it had 3 small pieces of chicken and was more like a garden salad will never go back,0
maria is amazing super personable and excited to help got me in right away took her time and made me feel extremely comfortable the office is clean and pretty blows miracle in progress out of the water i will definitely be returning,4
great sandwiches and great service  but whats with the no restroom policy  isnt it a requirement that a restaurant have a public restroom  the hand sanitizer thing hanging by the register isnt cutting it folks,2
a bit pricey but the subs are so delicious it is hard to resist i wouldnt say we are regulars but we return every once in awhile,3
i love capriottis just not this location dirty restaurant and employees that looked like they were hired right out of a homeless shelter,1
great service and friendly staff in and out quickly will go back for additional services when my truck needs it,4
gina was great and i really enjoyed the service  thank you,4
jim and steve did a great job with my two emission tests   it was fast and a great price   super customer service and a nice clean facility,4
i only get the carmel flanthey hit the spot but ive had betterfor the 2 price you cant go wrong with that,2
i love my chicken sald with the cilantro dressing and there new carnitas tacos ummm ummmm ummmm ummmmm ummmmnive been getting the same thing for a long time until the taco came out  lol  i usually stick with what i really like,3
dr camp is unprofessional moneyhungry and does not care about patients or their conditions,0
seems from the reviews that more than my motherinlaw have been screwed over by this location and false reports of damage i would steer clear or take pictures of every inch of the car before and after renting,0
my husband and i had a bad experience renting a car in la vegas they tried to charge us for gas even though we filled up before we returned the car  we had a receipt so we were able to get it removed why should we have to go through the hassle,0
just got off phone with service manager they returned my vehicle to me with a coolant hose disconnected service manager said  sorry but my tech did nothing wrong must of been miscommunication between my wife  service advisor really this is how your manager handles my survey complaint,0
scam for profit non accredited scam school you are better off spending 9000000 on mega bucks,0
its for profit university that only graduates 25 unlv is at 40 nothing about this place says it anything more scam to line some else pockets,0
the service department is a joke do not take your land rovers here,0
best sandwich in vegas excellent friendly service worth a visit if youre in the neighborhood,4
two words tina mateo she makes this place fun to hang out at anytime the food and gaming specials are great too limited graveyard menu as well,4
yummaaaaaaayopen till midnight chill outside on the patio at night or during the day if its not 110 degrees fresh veggies tasty blue cheese dip weird baked beans more like baked bean soup they tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready you may want to call ahead if your impatient,4
negative food was totally bland until i ate a retadro pepper that burned my tongue so i couldnt tell it was tasteless decent delivery time but yea no,1
yuck everything i ordered tasted gross  ive been here often years before and this was my first time back in over 2 years i didnt complain i sucked it up paid the bill and will never be back only good thing about the place cheap beer,0
mikkie finnzs sister bar next door the food is almost as horrible  the fish and chips suck and so does the whole menu do not eat here,0
loved the shepherds pie  waitress was good and attentive  i love irish bars  i think its best place i have gone to for a place on fremont street,2
average burger  salad beerbar joint,2
my husband and i are locals we went here for our anniversary on a saturday night it was our first time and it was great the waitress was so nice and the food was amazing great beer selection as well we had a nice quaint table outside and loved being able to sit outside and eat,4
it was my first time ever going and i really liked the atmosphere and the staff was really nice i got chicken chow mein and edamame and it was surprisingly good reminded me of pf changs yes i know they are owned by them as well it was all the taste for half the cost works for me,3
we love this place it is like pf changs but less expensive it is casual dining great service and i love that you can see into the kitchen get the pei wei card if you go often you can earn a free entree easy takeout too,3
i waited forever for our food and it was just two of us the entrees were incredibly bland i will probably not returnnnnice atmosphere though,1
what the hell happened here the service is slow food is mediocre quality is slipping dining area is dirty and decrepit this used to be an inexpensive alternative to pf changs now its a half step above dennys youre off your game big time,1
couldnt tell the difference between the orange and the kung pau chicken the fried rice was mushynnwont be going back,0
i love chicken wings my fave is parmesangarlic,4
their service has improved tremendously and the staff is very upbeat and proactive,3
teriyaki in a bowl  quick order spicy chicken nnim sold although how its right next to 24hour fitness throws me off a bit but their meat is nicely marinated and cooked along with veggies and an option of either white or brown rice and even noodles,2
i never really liked this place every time i dined here i always had a bad meal not worth the money the seafood dishes are bad and the meat dishes are even worse i think red lobster is better not by much save your money and do not even come here,0
dr nathan blanton was the reason i used to go to this location of mountain west chiropractic since dr blanton is no longer practicing at this office i stopped receiving treatment here  i have now have no idea of the quality of treatment this office now provides,1
talk about the perfect place for all your edc and or any other rave needs fun costumes jewelry and an array of nylons im sure youll find anything you need here if your a go go dancer in town this is a must store the owner is super nice and helpful as well,4
had one great experience one terrible and a lot of so so in between it would help if they didnt  change the entire staff every week,2
went here because of the great reviews on yelp the place is small but the service is really good managed by a single lady tried pad thai pork and crispy garlic chicken pad thai was a little too lemony the food is flavorful but ive had better thai food for the price,2
great corner suite room for great price but its far from everything except the shopping center across the street room service was not good served hawaiian rolls from vons  one of the tvs didnt work and the front desk couldnt figure it out would i stay here again no,2
i will not stay there again  the train is a deal breaker for me  the rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional,2
ordered for delivery here because i was at the towneplace suites nearby  lots of food and the sushi was awesome  delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night,3
so we arrived there for dinner yesterday after spotting it last week leaving walgreens  dining room was empty and not one clean table available  place was dirty so we can only imagine what the kitchen looks like  with that in mind we left and dont plan on ever going back,0
i was very happy this time when i went to hana  they have the wild salmon back which is so amazingnthe place is small and fills up fast on any given night  i love that you can bring your own beer wine and saki,4
the service was excellent  it was very busy so we opted to sit outside its byob so that was disappointing the food was ok it was certainly edible and the presentation was nice it just wasnt awesome,2
decent grub although the grape leaves sucked and the service while quick was rude no atmosphere much better med food in the burgh,1
1 week after being charged the 25 no refund  we called back today and a manager will need to call us back  if that manager doesnt call back today and handle it then well have to file a fraudulent charge with our bank against the bar,0
cool spot sitting right above the water outside people watching seafood tasted frozed and not fresh never a good look for a seafood spot bikers were in the way of the service staff slowed service down a lot might return for lunch,2
billys ultimate steam pot and oysters are great it sits right by the water too,3
nice location  utterly forgettable food  insanely slow service  the place was slow and the waiters just could not have cared less about our group  sort of unreal,1
cute place the service was very good really nice friendly waitress the food was good i had fish tacos they were tasty my husbands ribs were very good my daughter tried the buffalo chicken salad and she really liked it i would absolutely go here again,2
they need to find a better way of washing dishes our coffee cups had stains all over cutlery had pieces of food and had egg smell all over,1
love this place my friends and i go here often for breakfast the mardigras omelette is good as well as the eggs benedict this place gets busy in themornings on sunday so there will be a little bit of a wait sometimes overall good breakfast or brunch place they also serve dinner as well,3
this is a great place to grab lunch they have great soups and sandwich combos and its got a great vibe inside love it and will go back soon,2
the location is nice and the food is delicious i got the market fish which was very good the meat was so tender other yummy dishes were duck and pork,3
prociutto was yummynnveal meatballs were awesomenngood starters but the reason we came here was for the pizza  never againnnpizza  took one bite and that was it  yuk  among the worst ever  it was crunchy  like biting into a cracker  nnbatali should be ashamed of himself,1
good food service  in a cozy atmosphere,3
twice ive caught espresso royale staff overcharging me for my drinks mind this if you are ordering a tea latte because somehow they charge you for a coffee latte instead which is way more expensivennin addition i caught food poisoning from their mango smoothie,0
yay sephora is finally here this is the only reason i decided to return to jcpenney i was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales in fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance i may actually start shopping here again,3
you cant beat an 8 indian lunch buffet however only one of the dishes on the buffet has any meat and it was some overcooked chicken besides that the mushrooms were excellent and the staff was friendly ill definitely be stopping in again someday,3
i went to the new location awhile back and it is okay  if you like bbq then this place has to be on your list to try in las vegas,2
what the pho bones all in your chicken soup service is slowi had faster refills on drinks playing slotsavoid this placetheres a little pizza shop over by starbucks cheap and fast,0
like dennys but more overpriced i enjoyed my carrot apple bundtshaped muffin and had a nice waitress no ambiance to speak of unless dennys is your game,2
eaten here three times each time the food has been fresh and really good great service as well,4
i like this place been coming here for years chefs are fun and servers are friendly  good food and great price  try it,4
i miss this place  lots of live plants inside and food that brought me right back home,4
dubstep hipster bar  maybe i am getting too old for this stuff but after a few drinks and some fun girl date company it wasnt so bad especially since this is not my scene the roof dance floor with projector screens of trippy colors made the whole thing as well as the hipster sightings,2
good stuff much needed on a hot day,3
ok for a starbucks its very busy which makes it noisy and the staff hurried the furniture especially the armchairs are comfortable and a decent place ti sit and read,2
delicioiusnnand they even have chopped fresh wasabi   nni got a roll and a bunch of nigiri and everything was awesomennloves it,3
been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure  this time i sat at the bar and sushi chefs were totally out of touch and i practically had to yell at them to get my rolls but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar,0
average sushi at best  we ordered yellowtail appetizer kai roll salmon killer and kiss of fire rolls  good but not remarkablennservice was basic  recommendations were not anything more than pointing to a menunneven the recommended chocolate truffle dessert was average,2
nice hotel for young people bad experience dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation the food at koi was a joke worst hotel i have stayed in and i go to vegas a lot dont waste your money,0
very poor service it took 6 hours for them to clean up my room 3 calls and a conversation with the manager ended with him telling me just had to wait and then he insulted me will not stay here again,0
june 29th one nightnnfor business never againold rooms bad service and horrible clientele nnavoid this place if you can its not worth it there is a reason why the rates are so lownngo cosmopolitan instead,0
the hotel rooms and hallways are dark and depressing  even the elevators are dark and depressing  the casino is great though the buffet is awesome  i think i will stay at the paris and walk over to gamble and eat at the buffet,1
the rooms are so gross and dirty  i got a skin infection from it  really needs updating a  good cleaning  very outdated  difficult to find anything in the hotel mainly the gym  stay elsewhere,0
first time in vegas and i stayed here decent room loved the set up of the gambling floor awesome restaurants and friendly staff i would come here again,3
they really do make you eat with your hands the food was decent the soup was good but it got cold really fast the game hen was good just a bit dry the desert was blah the show is funny but really really corny great for kids tho,2
if you are on a salt restricted diet dont eat here everything is over salted and some is actually so salty it is inedible,1
must support this shop and stop by whenever i get in town  very dope selection with a lot of hype kicks and gear  i appreciate the staff for being chill and not bothering  when trying to browse  get some kicks and   rockem right,3
if you are looking for a funky pair of sneakers this is the place to go they have an awesome selection  i will definitely be back,4
dang i love eating with my handsand it does not get better than this,4
ummmlainie b or larnia b needs to take this rating as constructive criticism and do something about it instead of calling me names and posting it on yelp if you cant handle the criticism hunny learn to give good service i guess man vs food did a good job featuring the crawfish but not the employees,0
king crab legs were great but the place leaves you smelling so bad that its not worth it,0
awesooooooome ask for noelle great service  fantastic food,4

i love this place every time i go to vegas i have to get stop here for lunch they have the best hot pastrami sandwich highly recommended,3
price update sandwiches are now 325  they went up 25nvery peculiar experience today at dakao ordered a veggie sandwich and was told not available but all other sandwiches have the same veggies  place is still dirty and has a peculiar smell not from baking bread either,2
the banh mi here is good not great like places in oc the bread and vegetables are fresh they load too much meat in the sandwiches which maybe some people will like but it really should be a balance to be a great sandwich,3
lobster grilled cheese  that is all,3
service was good clam chowders are delicious but oysters were a let down they were different sizes and flavors i also wouldnt order the crab legs  they were pretty average there is a dish called roasted crab with sauce that is very good  i would recommend that and the chowders,2
loved it my boyfriend and i are so happy and could not stop talking about our experience the food was not the best but it was good and we had nothing negative to say so romantic and intimate and great service,3
5 the view from our table was spectacular n5 the veal parmigiana was delicious n2 the waiter who sat us was very pleasant but never returned  the wait nearly 35 minutes later after submitting it was agonizing  it left a bitter taste in my mouth poorly executed,2
this place is literally on top of a nightclub if you like feeling at 152am that youre in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you unfortunately for me i like to sleep i will never stay here again,0

great peking duck  chinese sausage fried rice  nice restaurant inside and great service,3
we made the mistake buying a expensive deal voucher expecting a high end chinese meal the food was bland but worse was the miserable staff not a smile among them with the exception of our waitress im beyond upset that i spent as much as i did for 10 chinese deal,0
definitely something that you have to try when you visit pittsburgh  whatever you order it will be a greaseball  ketchup and red devil hot sauce made my sandwich pretty tasty but i think for that much grease it should have been phenomenal not just pretty good,2
a friend and i went here for lunch  the place was busy so we ate at the bar  the service was outstanding and the food was great  i had the southwest wrap and my friend had the mediterranean wrap  the food came out quick and was delicious  we will definitely make it a weekly lunch stop,3

everything that ive tried has been simply delicious the sweetest people work here and although it gets a bit busy during the popular lunch and dinner hours its so worth the small wait d go right now  haha,4
mike l 1111 review is spot on  broth is clear but pho was a bit meager at especially 799 bowl prices or even std cheaper phoenix pricingnni dont think a bathroom really exists for customers so wee or pee boys and girls before you come,2
i really like this place  the taste is good but i like people there the servers look like they are brothers but all are very quiet but kind and dont bother you with over kindness and their boba tea is the best in town,4
honeydew boba is so yummy ive had better pho  servers are nice,2
drove around 30 trying to get some doughnuts found this place and my wife asked if they had sugar free doughnuts  the lady told us we had the wrong place in a hella rude attitude,0
miss eating here yummy food and always fresh since they have there own veggie garden,4
loved this place  burgers are awesome  especially with the baked potato fries  loved sitting outside  great family place,3
excellent breakfast and a fun place to go with kids we have only ever had breakfast here and on their breakfast menu the waffles amazing the breakfast tacos and scramble bowls are excellent too,4
was an ok experience love the picnic tables however not the dirt  not sure there is much you can do about the flies being outside  would really like to see an area to refill coffee instead of standing in line at the food window behind several people,2
by far one of my favorite places to eat in the east valley the food is always delicious and the veggies are so fresh the milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it,4
best start to my days and always a favorite amongst visiting family and friends cant beat the cupcakes or breakfast also a great place to drink coffee relax hangout or study,4
ew theres always a blonde girl working in the kitchen with her hair down and i found a piece of hair in my food im sorry but thats just gross also there was flies everywhere the place has potential but needs to work on a few things,0
at first site of the menu i wasnt impressed but once the food arrived i was indeed satisfied and the peanut butter chocolate pie topped it off at the end i love how mostly everything on their menu is grilled great healthy place to eat with family nice and affordable,2
food was bad service was non existent we had to go find our server to ask for our check restaurant was ambienceless no wonder it was 90 empty when we walked in,0
great little neighborhood spot  great breakfast and good sandwiches for lunch  we have been there 20 times with no issues and good food each time,3
i heard the food is good i will visit very soon,1
if that beach burger wasnt sooo goodnncustomer service is out the window when it comes to this place nnsometimes bad enough to where id just rather go to the million other places that serve burgers just as good or better with even better customer service,1
cheerful service for an early monday morning at the airport too bad the food is awful  beans cheese tortilla  how hard is that and expensive for what you get too better choice a 5 banana  water fountain sip pass,0
very busy pricey 14 for a margarita that wasnt the greatest food is ok i wouldnt call it authentic place was packed grab a seat when you caneven if it is dirty,2
not great but it is an airport,1
ordered the carne asada  huevos and i requested the eggs medium i think that threw them for a loop they forgot my salsa and sadly they never got around to bringing it the carne asada was of good quality but was served lukewarm which tells me it was sitting oh well i left full at least,1
im afraid the genius of wing leis tastes and textures was too subtle for my overstimulated palette had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didnt find any remarkable,2
im from new york and take cab rides everyday never have i been so annoyed at the rude behavior from a taxi cab driver before i along with my family was told that our destination of three miles was too short and a waste of money for the company the fare was 15 dollars so be the judge taxi driver 5698,0
extremely loud the smoked turkey sandwich bread was dry pear salad was good usual,2
average show worth the price of free if you can get them juggler comedian was the highlight,2
friendly staff and i come here for the 5 gyro sandwich lunch special someone else ordered meatball and pasta and has been very content,4
i tried a simple cupcake the vanilla cupcake was moist however the buttercream icing was hard possibly old and enough to turn me off i may try this place again if im in the area but i wont make a special trip,1
love this place friendly staff good prices lots of locals constantly in here great desserts and cakes that are never frozen red velvet cake was incredible and now they have donuts,3
incredible food and service  i had their pumpkin curry  very good unlike many thai restaurants this one has a heat scale from 1 to 5 and i ordered a 5  now i like my curry spicy but a 5 might have been too much    try the green tea ice cream  its delicious   i will return to this gem,4
i usually get the pad thai and spring rolls the soups are fantastic and quite authentic but are huge portions not the prettiest setting but definitely some of the more authentic thai food in the phoenix area,3
i dont quite get this place or why asians love it but it is very good,3
its target so i love it but i like the one off flamingo and 215 better the return desk is kinds awkward and the woman behind it gave me a hard time about missing a coupon when i walked right over i like travis at this location though hes a good guy,3
meh could take it or leave it  cashier took 10 minutes to write our id numbers down when ordering wine with dinner because a person in our party looked under 21 but was in fact 30 food was so so aside from salad other dishes were just meh the french onion soup was good tho prolly wont eat here again,1
absolutely love this place a locally owned pizza place that has been here for years i love the nuclear fries with ranch dressing speaking of ranch dressing they make it themselves and sell it by the bottle i personally like the pizza cut in squares by far the best pizza in town,4
berthas cafe just opened up at its new location 32nd street and indian school rd  i have been going through withdrawl so happy they are open,4
galbitang galbi soup tastes like nondairy creamer  water absolutely disgusting and when i complained to the owner he was disrespectful to the point where he pissed off all 4 of us it will be ridiculous to call this place an authentic korean restaurant,0
we had the seafood pancake and tofu pot  tofu was good seafood pancake was lousy  lots of koreans so that does not say muchnnservice was so so,2
great service and friendly staff we ordered the short ribs and spicy pork they were both flavorful and tender we also go 6 side dishes to go with our lunch,3
i love this place because its similiar to our yummys back home the food is sooooo good i always get the kalbi and meat jun combo but i can never decide on the side veggies you get to choose as i want all of them i highly recommend this place i consider it my holeinwall place,4
excellent food excellent service comfortable family restaurant highly recommend even if you have never tried korean food before,4
my favorite place in pittsburgh the craig street location has a great bar,4
loved it  food was fantastic and the restaurant and bar were very comfortablegood balance of trendy and casual,4
there is no reason why this shouldnt run 247  it doesnt open weekdays until 9am and closes around 10pm11pm  weak saucennits good enough for what it does in providing quick transport to mandalay bay to tropicana avenuebut its times leave much to be desired,2
i really dont understand how they still on business they dont care about the customers that go in the store at all i order some cupcakes for my sons bday and cancel them after i think of my experience after i left the store the owner of the store really have to do something,1
i will judge a city by its cupcakes no big dealnnmy perfect mad hatter cupcakenchocolate cupcake was moist and not too dense ganache filling was perfectly sweet and strawberry frosting was to die for love the concept of build your own cupcakes,3
ok bareable but not goodnnbeen here many times keep trying to believe big bens will come thru oh wellnnfood is still par absolutely nothing to write home aboutnnand the barhow frustrating  still charging way too muchnnwe truly tried tried and tried again   good bye big bens,0
8 times out of 10 i love this place occasionally theyll mess up an order but are good about getting it fixed also the service is slow sometimes but other than that everything is tasty its also a really cool place to sit outside  enjoy the view,3
wonderful place for burgers   the trio was a great way to try 3 different options   tyson our waiter was wonderful   he took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion  we will be back again soon,4
this has to be the best place on the strip to get your gourmet burger fix  i have been coming to stripburger for years  i have never been disappointed with their food and service i highly recommend the cheesy fries,2
amazing nacho fries intelligensia coffee awesome friendly servers and big juicy burgers this place is soo good my friends and i had a great time here the wait was short and the food was fantastic we will definitely come back the next time we go to vegas,4
pretty good subs,3
smokehouse beef brisket and cheddar is the absolute best sub ever this may be blasphemy but the brisket n bbq sauce in this sandwich rivals that of any bbq joint ive ever been to yes its that damn good go and get one now,3
just wanted something quick and gave this place a trynit was ok because i was hungry and service was goodnstill cant beat the sushi at takamatsu which is only yards away down the street,2
expensive compared to other thai restaurants service is bad run away if your server is yok she scares me,1
great gelato with plenty of flavors try the hazel nut,3
my husband and i frequent this gelato shop and love the quality of their gelato in addition to the frequently rotating flavors i highly recommend giving this locally owned shop a try plus with the great 5 for 10 yelp deal you cant go wrong that plus 15 cents will get you two larges,4
went yesterday with a girlfriend got 4 different cupcakes  yummy  i highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow,3
cupcakes and frosting shots oh my  this place is always busy and i think its the cupcakes  my absolute favs are the cinnamon and red velvet cupcakes  i cant wait for the pumpkin cupcakes that come out in the fall,3
you can some up the sprinkles experience in one word ridiculousn1 ridiculous linen2 ridiculously overpricedn3 ridiculously tiny tiny tiny cupcakesn4 ridiculously bad tasten5 ridiculous to go to sprinkles instead of just buying from your local grocery store bakerynnridiculous,0
ok they ae jopen but rareley on time  the woman on duty even as waitress  is the worst waittres  i have ever expere in my life dont shop her awful sevice,1
great food reviews on wwwbigtsreviewscom,2
nice happy hour spot in downtown phoenix their sunday brunch is good as well kind of a small establishment nice friendly staff,2
the food is terrible we went for happy hour and get the caprese and the calamari the caprese was like eating diced tomatoes that had been stewing in something the calamari was small and predominately breading,0
the barbacoa could use some actual spice and its a little expensive,2
oh my gosh  hot dogsgreat onion ringsgreat chili cheese friesgreat 50 cent soft serve conesawesome  just want to add that so far there hasnt been anything that weve tried here that we havent liked,4
it was ok  had better,2
this place has teenagers running the place customer service is horrible you are often greeted with attitude and a 15 min way on drive through with no car in front of you,0
galleria mall is the last decent locals mall,3
really oddly laid out it spirals in on itself but it has great stores especially the abc stores they have all the casual snacks and stuff youll need there are some upscale stores and some really affordable ones since im not a high roller i prefer this mall,3
did not care for miracle mile shops at allthe least exciting of the strip shops  selection is that of a regular mall no labels you couldnt find elsewhere the sole redemption of miracle mile shops might be sephora for lastminute needs dont  care for the crowd here  can be sketch,1
this is probably the best mall in las vegas  nit has a wide stores selection and great pricesnthey have an amazing restaurants and great womens care places this is my favorite mall,4
good large burger got paris onenavg friesnawesome milkshakenngot 30 groupon and really enjoyed it,3
good selection of machines comfortable environment and down to earth friendly people,3
its okay place but i recommend go eat at the palms for late night food the palms is cheaper and taste betternnlate,1
really good ahi tuna steak especially if youre drunk and need something to even out the alcohol servers are nice and quick,3
i am never coming here again for the price we paid we could have had a much better meal and gambling money leftovernnbland and tastelessnnyou can come the first time to collect miniature jars of ketchup and tabasco sauces if youd like,1
kinda like a family italian joint but too bright inside food is good enough for what it is and service is sufficient food is a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 not great not bad cutesy place with an almost feel experience it for yourself you will understand what i mean,2
always need more check outs in the morning,2
kevin and his team did a great job of getting our sunscreens up on our house with a tight deadline they were professional and at the end stated if there is anything you find that needs attention dont hesitate to call,4
we went to claim jumper after an imax movie with another couple just for dessert  they got us right in  i have a nut allergy and could not eat any of the desserts because they contained nuts  the only thing i could eat was a sunday and it was nasty  oh and not impressed with the coffee,1
disappointing meal here tonight had a seafood platter fish and shrimp were fried in semirancid oil you have to change your oil occasionally also nothing to dry your hands in mens room  no air dryer paper towel was completely out i expect waaay more for the prices you pay here,0
the food was good but was way overpriced reminded me of dardanelles on monroe street nndecor is cool though,1
excellent service great food nthe staff is really nice and accommodating we eat at bunkys frequently and i just hosted a baby shower there  they did a great job of accommodating my budget and making my friend feel very special  i highly recommend them for catering as well,3
i usually go here instead of the surprise walmart because it seems less crowded and is closer to me i dont like that they dont have selfcheckouts here though sometimes ive had to wait in line for awhile when i only had a few items,2
love to watch movies and i love this theatre  they have tons of options all of the time and really large theatres which makes it nice  always clean and lots of variety,4
take and bake sign was small and hard to see out of towers  talked to staff about visiting nothing mentioned about cooking it the establishment seemed to have some cooking facilities but staff was no help very poor questioner service,0
got very very sick off the french dip  service was without a smile long wait  would not recommend,0
great food awesome service from ramon appetizer main course and desert all perfect the menu looks so good we are already talking about returning and discussing what we want to try i dont know how this place remained elusive for so long,4
this place is drowning my food with canola oil yikes heart attack awaits me if i continue to eat here,0
hmm had a not so good experiencenprobably not going back nnwell i guess even the coolest places have to have growing painsnoh and the music sucks now the now have two boys that sound exactly alikenneven more offensive one of the guitarists was smoking near my table as he was setting up,1
went there for lunch today and had a very good turkey and brie sandwich,2
delicious chicago vienna beef juicy hot dog with the works and made from scratch french fries for 4 best deal in town thanks for reading the bike chaplain,3
this is the best dry cleaner i have found they do a great job and have a very convenient pick up service their representatives are always professional and courteous i would recommend them to anyone,4
overpriced and nothing special tried it twice in a year money better spent elsewhere,0
great food  great service and a place to watch world cup games at lunch time during work hours i had the three taco platter with shrimp  pork  and beef  all were very good  the salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition,3
this is a big place but rooms are just okay a bit outdated i had ants in my bathroom,1
i really enjoyed my stay here and will be backnhighly recommend if your looking for a top tier hotel off the strip neverything from the room staff grounds were just about flawlessnonly gripe was with the quality of the restaurants and buffet which just really all needs to be revamped,3
i was slightly hesitant in eating here again because the last time i ate here i threw up this time around i got the tomato basil soup and chopped salad the food was pretty good and the service was okay i probably wont be back here primarily because a lot of the dishes were so damn expensive,2
place suckslong lines poor customer service first u stand in a amazingly long line to get the fabric cut and then a equally long line for checkout darn my kids art project,0
oh boy was i pleasantly surprised by this delicious place always stop by starbucks and this time i decided to try it and oh boy was i missing it it is just simply delicious their egg drop soup is phenomenal their teriyaki chicken out of this world would decently recommend it,4
you will never leave here hungry  such generous portions and great prices,4
the dresses are wonderful and they range from xs to 3x nnhowever it is a painful experience everytime i shop there the sales clerks are just too cool to help me,2
we made a special trip to the store so after fighting strip traffic 30 min trying to find parking and another 20 min walking we made it there nthe staff was very nice and helpful but the clothes were pretty ill fitting so with sadness i left empty handed,2
i have never been to a store ran by a bigger bunch of assholes in my whole life id feel better having abandoned hygiene for a week and going to a ferrari dealer,0
of all the lodges this one has the best bartenders and servers all others have left a bad taste in my mouth this location is awesome and will recommended to anyone,3
im so sad that they closed this place down and turned it into a mexican cantina they had the best tapas and sangria happy hour in las vegas,2
im really glad these tickets were free because i knew it was a dud the first 10 minutes of him going on and on just talking about the whole mentalist background this show couldnt have been over soon enough a real disappointment and not at all entertaining skip it,0
the check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show the show itself was fine but not worth more than 10 dollars,0
short and to the point the food is good littleneck clams as steamers for about 11 a dozen moose drool on tap,3
awesome desserts  wide variety  decent price,4
allyoucaneat fish fry is the way to go  friday nights  hot fresh and quick  latenight is the best,2
i was pretty bummed when the phoenix location closed  you can always get a hearty breakfast here  i like the spicy inhouse sausage  biscuits and gravy on the side and you are talking my language,2
maybe this even deserved just one star the breads are just a bit better than mediocre and the sandwiches are well sandwiches,1
dirty low ceilings but decent n10 pai gow nas low as 3 craps the electronic one in the front where if you sit on the left side of the table you get a pretty nice view of the dancing ladies  otherwise its as low as 5 craps on the other tables,2
i never knew this was the name of the place until saturday morning at 330am oo oops nnnot the nicest looking place inside but its kept very old schoolnngot that drais inside,2
great food  had the carne asada plato special which was really tasty friend had killer burrito off menu which he loved service was so so the man at the register was fantastic drinks not refilled and no one came back to check on us all forgivable  well be back for sure,3
pretty pricey and the food is just ok i have eaten there a few times and every time i came away thinking it wasnt worth the money there are way better options in pittsburgh,1
low key atmosphere on mondays they have 5 burgers when you buy a 3 beer great deal and great food,3
the food alone its worth the trip,3
nicer decor and feeling than you might expect in a local casino i tried their most popular roll sampler and a sweetspicy beef stir fry dish id go here again and glad to have something like this out in this part of summerlin,2
momo sushithank you for introducing me to the bento boxes  cant get a better deal than thatnni love this place  i lived way across town  but when i do get the craving no doubt i pay my homage to you,3
ordered the momo and seafood bentos tastes good but ive definitely had just as good or better elsewhere for less  the sushi was messy and poorly put togethernngf says to add that she really liked the age dashi tofu yes i agree that was good,1
fast and friendly service had a yelp voucher and they were happy to accept it fair priced and the sushi rolls were yum would recommend,4
came with friends and had a great time  food was amazing  service was good will be back,3
they dont put the price on their drinks and the margarita was 15 dollars service was slow food was okay,1
darts and beer cant say much else,2
im impressed with this pizza  mozzeralla provolone blend just enough provolone to make it enhanced  the service was excellent  in the past i have been unimpressed with this place yesterday they were on,3
we had breakfast here before checking out had no complaints at all i had the steak and eggs with potatoes i was great only problem was some kind of sauce on the steak but i knew it was going to be on it so thats my fault overall it was a good breakfast,2
have to ask for refills and waitress just stands around after taking your order everyone walks around with an attitude and its depressing and horrible service  this will be the last time i come here,1
went with a family group of 12 and no one had anything good to say about their meal,0
they definitely need to work on customer service i probably wont eat sushi for a year after dining here,0
i had not been to bev mo for a long time and when walking around i remembered why this place is so overpriced  save yourself some money and head over to total wine plus a lot better craft beer selection,0
love bevmos 5 cent wine sale and now it is all the time and you can even mix and match what a great way to try new wines ni only wish this store was larger the one at tempe marketplace is bigger and had a better selection but it farther away for me,3
they have a nice assortment of music on the weekend  the drink menu is comprehensive we were happy with what was offered spacious and we were comfortably seated  much nicer than so many other bars around town  nit reminded us of a cruise ship,2
extremely disappointed enough said,0
very pricy for the quality of food you getdefinitely dont come here for the service,1
we got a calendar from half moon on super bowl sunday and have gone in many times since then  there are free items when you buy the calendar every month  happy hour and reverse happy hours are great with 3 draft beers and half off wings and other apps my husband is a huge fan of the wings,3
hit this place at ballys a couple of times for their breakfast buffet good price not a huge selection but the scrambled eggs and biscuits  gravy are both very good,2
run dont walk away from the express breakfast buffet way overpriced for inedible food ive had better free hotel continental breakfasts this place is horrid,0
wanted to try this place since it had the shortest wait time well now i know why maybe i ordered the wrong thing but the black pepper chicken didnt have much flavor at all i was very disappointed and will not be coming back,1
the menu is minimal and the burgers are solid  quick and easy,2
totally unimpressed it was sat afternoon my wife had an urge for innout the closest one was tempelocation burgers were dry bun was dry and the fries even though i know they are hand cut fresh are still not as good as mcdonalds i wont be back soon for a double double,2
looking for simple then its all about innout service is always good and quick got a doubledouble with some animal style fries and it was pretty satisfying,3
target is ok nothing stood out to me on the shopping trip had a nice selection and well lit aisles,2
awesome loose leaf tea spot in the north phoenix area you can have a cuppot of tea inhouse or buy a variety of teas to gonnhuge selection of loose leaf teas if youre a tea fan a visit to souvia is a mustdo,4
i had a burger here yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh it was amazing spicy and amazing  trust me please trust me,3
fantastic burgers i really like the exotics  sweet potato fries are great  wait staff has always been happy and polite,4
great alternative to the traditional burger joint ive been a chef in the valley for a long time and this place is one of my favorites great dinning experience lots of nice menu items you wont find anywhere else i suggest trying the bison sliders or if your adventurous the ostrich,3
phoenix airport and the whoppers here are delicious  service without a smile sucks though,2
i wouldnt consider myself a bagel connoisseur although ive been eating them for more than 15 years in the tristate area nothing really stood out but at the same time i was happy with my sesame bagel breakfast sandwich i wish it were a little less greasy though,2
took 10 minutes to get a sandwich corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot it was cold asked for a bagel to not be toasted they toasted it corned beef was dry might have been frozen never going back,0
the bagels are soso which is not a great thing if youre called the bagel factory the atmosphere is nice and so are the people,2
food was good but nothing special portions are small for what you pay you are better off going somewhere else will never go here again,1
i loved this experience they offer an ipad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about paris france the view is amazing we stayed to watch the fountain show below bellagio and the staff was great,3
enjoying an amazing birthday dinner with family and friends with a sushi feast to make the gods green with jealousy,3
had a great afternoon lunch on a saturday the food was great the beer was bar none the best and the staff knows their beer we did a tasting and had a lot of fun talking beer the place overall is a little down on its heels the waitress said they do a beer dinner and i can betcha it would be great,3
great beer selection but as far as the food and service goes maybe we were there on a bad day after ordering we waited forever for the food to arrive and once it did it was cold,2
word to the wise order your burger well done here you and your toilet will be thankful nnps employees handling food should always wash their handsnnthats all i am going to say,0
we headed here on saturday night  i like the concept and the food sounded tasty  i was also excited based on the reviews  unfortunately the food for our large group trickled out  slowly and it was only mediocre  the server was kind but overall not a good experience,1
sad to hear this beats the other italian joints in the city however the place is good and worth a visit strange layout  we sat upstairs and i had a wonderful view of a balcony wall that could have been much shorter or a railing,3
food was marginal i had a chicken taco plate and burrito that was flavorful and could have been worth the very long wait if their wasnt better available nearby nothing special here folks glad we didnt move to ahwatukee for the food,1
thought it was pretty ridiculous when i asked for no meat just beans and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because its considered making a substitution pretty poor customer service in my opinion i hope the gm reads this and corrects the problem,2
number 36 burrito you cant go wrongbeen going there since 82 and they havent lost a step,4
good food horrible customer service i continue to give them business because its close to work but otherwise i wouldnt bother nothing like being treated crappy while spending your hard earned money several of my coworkers have had the same experience,2
love the view from the hole in the rock butte good thing its quite an easy hike so im able to bring my boys here from time to time once youre up there you could see the phoenix zoo to the left sky harbor airport to the front and scottsdale to the right,4
wowthis was a fantastic experience,4
i wish the delivery guys would stop using my neighborhood like a race track,1
if you like clean beds and helpful staff then this is the place i just moved to henderson i use to go to the one on maryland parkway and i love this one better helpful staff and no waiting for a bednits recommended you make an appointment to get he bed you want but you are in and out in no time,4
love this place the ladies are pleasant here say hi to jordan and ashley when you get in and theyll take care of ya once you get the hang of this place and how it works you will realize how the services will help you maintain a nice and healthy life,4
the owners and service is very nice here i come here regularly and i can always expect everybody to be incredibly friendly the food is also exceptional  from crab legs to fried fish the restaurant is sure to offer a high quality meal for a reasonable price,4
the mens department has edgy clothes which dont work for me and i didnt really care for the awkward moment when i was going to buy something but didnt have an amex card with me  i then just walked down to nordstrom and found something i liked better and used my visa card to buy it,2
tried it while wandering around late at night after hearing all the hype plain and simple its a hot dog all be it an expensive damn hotdog chili tasted like it came from a can and the hotdogs were a little over cooked 40 bucks later i can now say ive had a nathans famous hotdog,2
i find their instructors voices speech cadence and pseudospiritual narrative to be awfully annoying i would rather they just allow some silence in the class but it is a good workout not too expensiveand i suppose its good practice to learn to learn to tune it out,1
prices reasonable and quick service  i had samin which was really tasty and received a good portion i would have preferred it served in a bowl to enjoy at the location than a deep styrofoam cup  and hawaiian music would have been nice to hear in the background,2
just went here the other night solid food awesome belgian beer,3
this is my goto restaurant for moules and frites  the beer selection is quite large and kind of   wine list is really good  stop by youll love it,3
ive been here many times because its close to where i liventhe menu is stale and the same old thingnthe food is pretty good nothing specialnbut is definitely overpricedngood luck,1
ordered a new york hot pastrami sandwhich on rye bread not even close  it was alright but not great there bagels are delicious tho i guess coming from nyc makes it hard to like the pastrami here,2
if this is the best kosher style deli that phoenix has to offer then its good when compared with other delis ive rated in new york las vegas and detroit its meh to poor pastrami was too fat pickles too salty decent sized sandwich priced a little high,2
pretty good but nothing special definitely better than ihop or dennys though have a few interesting omelettes and scrambles but nothign to really write home about would go again if im in the area and looking for breakfast but not making a special trip,2
great breakfast spot casual atmosphere and good food veggie benny is yum,3
definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast also a decent meeting spot for business breakfasts and lunches personally i think you can do better with the food but all around it is a bad joint,2
ugh mediocre at best,1
you would think in north scottsdale an honest person could leave their sunglasses on the table by accident come back the next day they would have been saved by the waiter or the busboy not at saltys they are thieves not to mention the food is aweful and the staff could care less about service,0
old school vegas feel love it delicious food one of my favorite steakhouses in the country,4
average food great ambiance and service the dumplings were outstanding thats about it i had some type of curry noodle dish with thin rice noodles it tasted just like pf changs  nothing special i did order two orders of dumplings because they were so incredible i would only come back for those,1
when i visit madison swagat is always on my list of restaurants always fantastic always friendlynn,4
super packed nntheres a stage with velvet red curtains we had a vip table but even the vip section was overcrowded nndont get me wrong i still had fun but there were just too many damn people,3
came here with a couple of friends on a saturday the layout of the club is nice but the place is too packed lots of older folks and couples as well as far as the music goes it was okay but i left after 30 minutes  waste of 30 dollars in my opinion,0
i was not impressed the cover was 30 for ladies and 40 for guys seriously i dont have a problem paying cover but 30 is excessive i ended up just heading over to a lounge that was also located in the luxor instead,0
pretentious over crowded rude bad terrible  no  so many better options,0
food is delicious i had the vegenini it is like a vegetarian pizza i loved it the potato fries are also delicious customer service is always friendly,3
hard to believe this place is right down the  strip from treasure island great thai food and really cheap pricesbe prepared to wait around lunch or dinner times as the place is small must try,3
oh this place is goodntheir portions are more than enough and everything tastes so home madennits open late im not sure how late but its open late and this is my go to place after i get out of class and want to grab some good asian cuisine,3
sep 25 2011 210 pmnn1 item lunch combo 550ncomes with soup entree appetizer nnred curry 35 little too oily for a thai dishngarlic and pepper stir fry 355nn2 thai iced tea 455nncustomer service 455,2
the service here is so slow i order ed my food at 430 pm and its still now done hurry up,0
omg horrible service never coming back here again ive given this place plenty of shots to prove me wrong but it just keeps getting worse and worse this time they took 20 minutes to sit us than another hour for me to get my food the place was not even that busy im done here,0
had a great time here drinks are about 14 each so be ready but the atmosphere was great they get some really good talent spinning here too not a dance floor per se but we did plenty of dancing as did everyone else,3
had their breakfast burrito without sausage and it was amazing and the price was reasonable too,4
when i was kid we would go to the symphony on almost a monthly basis they have really great guests that rotate through fairly regularly nnthe hall itself is simply beautiful and very comfortable its certainly a great aspect of the city and worthwhile thing to make a point to experience,3
i had the ribeye boneless medallions  it was three different meats  natural angus bison and  american wagyu medium cooked   it definitely made my top ten list in the steak department,4
our two steaks were raw in the middle not rare but raw around us other diners were calling the wait staff over for the same reason over cooked i can see  but serial raw horrible,0
o m g i think i died and went to wagyu beef heaven steak is amazing service is awesome food portions make it worth the price im coming back,4
very average  the big eye app was not fresh  the kobe beef carpaccio was flavorless and seemed like it might have been searednni left it at that before diving into a very overpriced steak,1
update as of 9 june memphis best is only open thursdaysaturday 11002000 gunny says theyre shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer whether hell go back to monsat in the fall remains to be seen,3
bunky provides something unique downtown that i desire nnthere is a small selection hence boutique but it is all amazing my first visit was at least an hour going through each item of clothing each with its own personality the accessories are amazing,4
if you like loud music and hearing even louder fbombs being dropped then this is the place for younnfood is okay but bar service is poor pretty bad when you have to repeatedly ask for silverware and a drinknnwith all the other great places around why waste your money here,0
free entrance if you print coupon from their website,4
really enjoyed myself at the auto collections the cars are beautiful and there are so many of them nnprice is reasonable 1250 i believennwould recommend to anyone who loves old cars,3
oh gosh the wife had a cesar salad and can we get some romaine hearts that arent ready for the trash the place smelled like vomit and there is a reason we havent been back in almost a year since before this visit im done time to clean up the place,1
decent place good food great  atmosphere to watch a game thank god the karaoke was not there tonight service could be better mainly faster the servers are spread too thin as there seem to never be enough top handle the crowd otherwise a decent pace too have a drink grab a bite and watch sports,2
the caramel ones were heaven on earth but i agree with the other yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry sidenni still have quite a few flavors to sample but from what i have seen so far they are not worth the price point,1
mac n cheese was damn good homemade bleu cheese was even better service was a little weak but overall the dive bar lounge atmosphere and great beer selections are solidnnwish they would expand the menu,3
good local place with no snottsdale attitude  cheap drinks  a funny crowdni read the 2 star review below  you have to consider the source a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar  get her drinksngo back to club douchey princess,3
i ordered pho dac biet and it phokin sucked only thing that was decent was the eggrolls decor was nice but food thumbs down,0
great pho im little saigon area in so cal so i know good pho this place is good i have never tried this place due to the bad reviews on yelp but tried it today and was pleasantly surprised they have a very big menu will definitely come back to try their other dishes,4
dont come here they are out of everything by 6pm staff seemed angry the place was full pork chop was cooked enough for a whole pig,0
this place sucks  the brother of the current owner owns lolos chicken and waffles  go to lolos  if you want to experience reverse racism as a white person go to the golden rule  complete ahole is running his mothers landmark into the ground,0
dont understand the hype about this place went in today only to be disappointed  nothing spectacular,0
this is my new favorite restaurant in goodyear  great service love the bartenders they are very attentive  the food is another plus you wont be disappointed,4
i have fond memories of this place growing up we would watch movies on the lawn on a big projector in the summer sled ride down it in the winter and play frisbee all other times when i was in college i would bring a blanket and my books to lay there and study in the sunshine nni love flagstaff hill,2
very urban chic their chai tea latte is one of the best ive had in vegas their breakfast items are overpriced especially since their bagels are supermaket sara lee brand however they have a honeybutter they serve with them that absolutely makes up for it,3
they keep deleting my negative review that the sharpstone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs  they sell them as if they are true sharpstone grinders,0
this place blows  staff doesnt have a clue about customer service except a cute waitress but she was working on the patio  food was blah  spring rolls with out thai basil seriously pho was alright but the sides of sprouts and basil were almost spoilednnhorrible no below average yes,1
i love this theater   2 tuesdays cheap popcorn and soda and there seats are so comfortable,4
a new found fav of mine try something different,4
good place to go to is your looking for a casual fun night out while stumbling back to you hotel,2
this place is terrible the whole idea of the place is dumb im not paying overpriced prices for bad service bad jokes and to be seated on a bench with other couples i left before i ordered,0
terrible food terrible over priced diner food dry chewy garbage super suburban restaurant that tries to be silly and fun but its just generic and terrible if i had 20 thumbs theyd all be down,0
food was alright but overpriced 1499 for a cheddar burger and fries burger was small and mcdonalds fries taste better than their fries drinks were good though overall it was a fun experience with the offensive hats and the waiters being dicks i would only go back to drink,3
great neighborhood place that serves delicious food late into the nightnnfirst room has a bar and a few tables through there is a second room all for dining with a window view to the streetnnunpretentious authentic tasty italian  sea scallops were perfect,4
a very nice seafood dinner for my family my wife loved the frutti di mare linguini my six year old loved my leek soup and tilefish especially the garlicky spinach and potato salad and i enjoyed what she left me nice wine selection and excellent bread definitely a repeater,4
casual loud ghetto creeps and cheap half naked butterfaces everything is good but her face nnew never again,0
food and drinks were decent for what you pay and not horrifically overpriced service wasnt bad compared to other places ive tried in vegas id go back nice atmosphere,2
bad food below average service need to be lit to eat at this place it will help,0
good time really good food  nice view of the strip,4
gosh charlotte must have low standards in sushi this place was fairly terrible threw away 80 of my order salmon should have a taste and rice should be white not 50 shades of gray,0
although the customer service was super pleasant the sub sandwiches were not  they are great for a drunk person that just has the munchies but not the place if you are looking for quality,1
the staff is really awesome and i grew up by an arcade so it definitley takes me back nnhowever on a busy night this place is clearly a spot for bad parents to go out and drink while their 8 kids run around one ran into me and i spilled some of my drink id say go to this place on a school night,2
birthday party for my son and a bunch of his buddies the boys really enjoyed the arcade games and all of them said that the food was great our waitress jessie was awesome,3
arcade for adults if you have nothing to do dave and busters is the place to go they have games you can grab a drink or something to eat this location is really great on service one bartender was doing tricks pretty awesome,4
a really good sushi bar in this tro of asian restaurants in the benihana village  i had lunch here during ces week and despite the large crowds service was still very good and the food outstanding,3
first time visitor  food was very good  service was very slow,3
a decent sandwich for a decent price not the best italian sandwich ive ever had but it was good  everything is u00c0 la carte though so it can get expensive  i dont know if i would go out of my way to get here just for a sandwich but if you are nearby it probably wont disappoint,2
so freaking good honestly the best blt ive ever had when we go to vegas this is always one of the first places we have to eat its cheap and really good,4
american sandwhich was really good cranberry sauce awesome cheese hot sandwhich,4
inside planet hollywood casino  i went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line ordered the full montagu nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beefturkey such goodness 599 decent price for the tastevalue,4
come here and grab a sangwich before you pregame and then again after hoeing around in the club the original and the tuna melt thats maaaah faaavorite enjoy,4
delicious hot sandwiches  opened 24 hours what more do i need to saynnoh get the meatball sandwich so good,3
when i am in the mood for a good sandwich i will drive 20 minutes to get to the strip struggle with traffic and parking and walk through a casino just to get to earl of sandwich  prices are good and every sandwich i have had there is fantastic,4
probably the best place to eat at the dead of night in las vegas cheap sandwiches 67 and open 24 hoursnnnothing really bad to say drunk food or sober food both great and at any time of the day,4
sandwiches are good prices are good for vegas open 24 hours a plus however i dont know how much out of the way i would go just to eat here esp if there was a long line definitely better than subways or quiznos its good but not nomilicious great i have to say i liked their bread a lot though,2
youve got to eat here if you are down on your luck and need a cheap meal to pick you back up  we walked all the way down the strip just to eat here,3
loved the tuna,4
words cannot describe the great flavors of their items this is a must try place,4
best sandwiches ever you will love it,4
i went there with some friends and we all liked it my wife and i had a vegetarian sandwich called a caprese my daughter had an italian and my friend had the montagu they were very inexpensive for the strip but i was hungry after my sandwich,3
the best sandwiches that i have ever had hands down  this shop is actually a big reason that we book our rooms at planet hollywood  breakfast sandwiches are amazing  we actually go to restaurants for drinks and then to earl of sandwich for dinner,4
best feature open 24 hoursnnsecond best feature the hawaiian bbq sandwich perfect with a bottle of blue moon and totally hits the spot at 3 amnnid avoid the daytime crowds plus there are far better lunchdinner options on the strip  but this would easily be my latenight goto spot,3
the prices are typical strip inflated 3 for a bottle of water the sandwich cost more than twice the cost at subway an the flavor was almost 10 of the flavorquality of the typical subway sandwich i wont consider returning,0
ive had waaaay better sandwiches its perfect for the late night smokers that dont care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed,1
good fast food sandwich shop ive been here probably 10 times and wasnt as wowed this trip to vegas as i have been the last few but still a good bite and pretty quick as long as the line isnt insane nnive never had a sandwich i didnt like though id say i could leave the salads ive tried there,3
love the thanksgiving sandwich  im obsessed with it actually i really wished we had one in scv even if im not hungry and theres one nearby i will pick up one of those bad boys and take it home for later,4
this place has really gone downhill in the last year customer service is bad  the sandwiches are just ok they do make a pretty good salad but i just cant get past the attitude of some newer employees i dont want these knuckleheads anywhere near my food,1
i do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in lv the sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is do not waste your time in their 2030 minute line marginal at best,1
awesome sandwiches very affordable we came here for a quick lunch and it was pretty damn good its kind of a food court atmosphere which i didnt care for but if your just looking for an affordable meal or lunch on the vegas strip this place is great,3
the bread is baked as your sandwich is made  got the reuben  sandwich  put all of the fillings on one half the pastrami was tasty but the sandwich fillings have gotten skimpier over the years  long lines around lunchtimennstill a good sandwich if you are willing to wait,2
disappointed in this sandwich bar  i had a salad which was ok  nothing to brag about  i was disappointed that the menu only had hot subs  no cold sandwiches,1
i dont get what all the hype is about earl of sandwich ive eaten here a few times and the sandwich is small i need to order at least two and the service is always slow looks like not everybody else here agrees with me but that is how i feel,1
yummmmm hot and toasty,4
omg the full montague is the best sandwich ever perfect amount of everything highly recommend the macaroni and cheese as well its worth the money,4
food portions were gigantic and flavorless service was absolutely despicable the server was sitting there texting on her phone charging me 3 dollars for hot water and a teabag and i was just sitting there staring out the bullet holes in the glass windows wishing i could have gone to wild thaiger,1
service was average had to send steak back as it was crunchy on the outside potatoes au gratin seemed like something out of a box waitress brought another member of our party the incorrect wine valet took 45 minutes to get our car in general a disappointing experience wont be back,1
i thought it was a little expensive for a salad in a box that i ordered from a counter and ate outside because it was so packed inside  it was a good salad though  i think i will try some other places on my find out where to eat lunch tour before i go back here,2
the food was great but the service was disappointing  we came here for a late lunch after spending a few hours at qua spa  the pizza here was amazing with generous toppings and a crispy crust  our server was not very responsive to getting water glasses filled and checking in on our meal,3
a favorite restaurant of ours  has a very good wine list and also very good italian food  yes the prices are high but where in vegas can you get the 199 deal anymore  the food is clean and straightforward not frilly and overdone  id recommend it to anyone who likes good italian,3
i had my wedding reception here and it turned out amazing lalana was great with every aspect of planning my wedding the food was amazing the service everything i was so happy i chose to have my reception here it made our day even more unforgettable,4
chicken parm was just average field greens salad was great wait staff was great the seating is right under the blue sky and in front of a large fountain in the forum shops,2
service is not so great took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn eggplant crisps are good margarita pizza came without basil tho  once fixed was good my italian soda never received,1
it works dont expect more or less than food court food from your local shopping mall,2
the display was great thats why i wanted to try but the taste is totally awful the pepperoni pretzel doesnt even taste like pretzel oily and tasteless  it tasted like uncooked dough totally a waste of money,0
love the staff love the beer love the patrons,4
traveling through town and found this brewery  they had a good selection of beer and i really enjoyed the fish tacos,3
finally popped by here for the gail ambrosius anniversary party the place is gigantic it was also really packed and parking was a pain the beer is always good i would have tried the food but the wait was too long will definitely be back,3
quick and tasty chicken sandwches nothing special,2
i was not expecting great sushi from a location that was formerly a village inn   fortunately the vi is long gone and the sushi was very good    nnits better than most of the other sushi places around and not too hard on the wallet,4
lets face it we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we know  trust me there is green grass on the other side  this place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare  hayley my server was the best  thank you,4
i would give it a zero if i could brings a very unsightly crowd to a good area,0
the steak here was not worth the price at alli really dont have much to say about this place besides stay away  its not worth your money or timehowever the decorations inside were very nice,1
good pho open all the time,2
i go there all the time i went almost every viet restaurant around the neighborhood and this place the best cheap and high quality food try pho combo and u wont regret it open 247365 and always clean and serve good food they give good amount of bean sprouts too highly recommended,4
i am not normally a painintheass orderer only at rubios because they have lots of things that i like but not all in the same burrito so i order one burrito and make about 22 changes to it nthis rubios got it right every single time and didnt give me an attitude when they did it either ni love them,4
this place wasnt for me had the mexiwrap zucchini pasta and acai bowl the mexican wrap was my favorite amongst the other dishes however when i got home i started feeling sick and ended up throwing up not coming back,0
best nan ive had in vegas  great bang for your buck  they even had the 799 lunch buffet on a saturday  who else does that  i look forward to trying the dozas the next time  they were all around 6 and huge,3
our favorite local steakhouse went on friday night to celebrate my husbands birthday adam the manager took great care of us and the food was great,3
veggie omelette was way over cooked  hard and dry  not good at all  very disappointing since i had had better food there a couple of years ago my companion experienced the same with her omelette so my advice  at the very least  dont order an omelette  especially given the price,1
food not that good fair price though i ordered a chocolate and is way too sweet you cant even take 2 or three bites because you will get sugar rush,1
easy accessible target always clean and neat it has the light rail right across an open not cluttered place probably my favorite target here in central phoenix,4
meh nnsuper slow going southbound in the morning ive discovered i can get to work quicker on surface streets which are no picnicnndecent ride when its not rush hour  nice view through the mountains,1
sumo sushi declined to use my restaurantcom coupon stating that all you can eat is a promotion and therefore does not qualify i printed the coupon that same day and there was no mention of not being able to use it for all you can eat the owner should honor these obligations and has chosen not too,0
had decent food but shitty service never returning,0
horrible service and my food was cold if they had been busy i might understand seeing as i used to be a server myself but we were the only people in the place and considering that ive had such great experiences at other kings locations i was very disappointed,0
i had dinner and drinks there tonight with friends i had the ahi tuna which was very good and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals as well the cosmopolitans were fabulous the only downside was that they had the bar window wide open and it was freezing in the restaurant tonight  100 for the 3 off us,2
the layout of the parking lot is not that great especially the first intersection you come to entering from mcclintock  the stores are good though and there is good variety to satisfy most of your needs  clean shopping center with good stores,3
awesome place if you want to almost get hit by a car an 8 year old can put together a more functional parking area,1
i avoid this mall  i hate parking here and trying to get in and out is always a hassle,1
the food is absolutely terrible at this qdoba or maybe it is all qdobas i dont know  either way qdoba does not stack up to chipotle  better than someburros  nope  better than fillibertos  not quite  better than taco bell  doubtful  better than a hot pocket  yes but what isnt,0
i have been here many times but the place seamed different this time  the veggi portions were tiny  the meat seemed tough and the waitres was less than accomedating  i think i will have to find a new place in townwhat a shame,1
worst service i have ever encountered  passive waiters and terrible manager  with 2 kids in tote you would think we could have had faster service    would never go back,0
one of the best showperformance ive ever seen i enjoyed it alot i love love love couldnt comment more about how great the show is although i am not exactly the beatle generation i enjoyed every moment of it nndont want to give too much away you wont be disappointed,4
cirque du soleil prices without the cirque du soleil talent  i kept waiting to be amazed by people doing things with their bodies that i cant do  thats why i pay you the big bucks people  the costumes and music of course are fantastic though,1
best show ive seen amazing stage show great remix of timeless beatles songs great looking dancers,4
this is hands down the best cirque show ever the acrobatics costumes stage props set and lighting are incredible unlike other cirque shows this one has a clear theme that it adheres to making every minute of the 15 hour show worthwhile nnyou have to see this if you are in vegas,4
great show if you like the beatles youll love this show drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch definitely worth the price of admission,3
excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline,1
just an ok show not worth the time and moneyna live band would have been better otherwise we could just stayed home and listened to our cds nlots of dancers and i guess they tried to describe the songs but they look so disorganized on stage,2
the rice is fluffy the salsa is perfectly mild the green corn tamale is wonderful the service is fast and friendly,4
i loved the molcajete the margarita was really good as well and it sneaks up on you i could barely make it to the car,2
the pizza is good but the pasta is outstanding nice quaint family outing place or a great place to take a date for a private dinner they also offer some good salads,3
this might be funny to some of you but i never seen a sun devil game here i was lucky to catch a few of the old usfl arizona wranglers or arizona outlaws games it was a lot of fun and i can only imagine how great it would be in a college atmosphere,3
a great showthank you asu marching band,3
ok tacos and margaritas  nothing to write home about,1
tequila tasting can we taste some tequila next time was a fun experience but the tequila wasnt even a half a shot,2
authentic chinese spicy food when i say spicy i mean it the heat here is not for the faint of heart everything is very good i would recommend bringing a chinese friend to help navigate the menu,4
eat here every couple of weeks food is good not great  but good  it is consistent and the portions are adequate,2
i like it hear had the perfect breakfast two eggs sunnyside up a slice of french toast and four turkey breakfast sausage it was the right amount and delish,4
i dont understand all the good reviews here the hibachi here is like avg mall food court quality i guess if you want quantity over taste this place does ok then,1
love this place their coffee drinks rock esp the cafe roma and their sandwiches and salads are to die awesome joint,4
i guess i agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has i like the concept love local joints enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines but that is about it the service timing and environment needs work,2
usually a good selection of brew  mostly california and other west coast breweries food above average  nservice tonight was very good but i have been there when its slownwell be back,3
decided to try this place for after dinner drinks with wifey they have a good selection of brews and an overall cool place to hang out  didnt have a chance to check out the food menu place is worth a visit for drinks or just hanging out,2
pepper jack lobster and shrimp tacos blue corn tortilia black beans and rice very cold beer good service,2
simply amazing,4
mmmm chicken teriyaki bowlnnthe chicken white fully cooked doesnt taste rancidnnthe rice also whitennthe veggies death by grillnnthe flavor meh,2
its vegas  they have baby free samples of frozen cocktail nni would have to say of all the quick bites held in ph next to earls of course would be fresh grill they have a friendly staff and decent bites of sandwich fresh house chips and all the different types of sauces you want,2
the food is ok not mind blowing its basically just snack food not real meals id call it a classier mc donalds i purchased a refillable souvenir cup but i had to pay 100 each time i refilled it can you say false advertisement,1
swanky place good atmosphere  food right in the heart of madisons cultural center a great place to meet friends for food  drinks even catch the game  the bar,3

dive bar i guess but the food drinks service and atmosphere are top notch we ordered their bbq bacon burger green chile mac  cheese and grilled wings all were delicious bonus they have shuffle board and big buck hunter this bar is legit i plan on becoming a regular,4
heart bar holds a special place in my heart  why  because i met a 14large bachelorette party at this bar  needless to say it was a perfect weekend  nnnote unless youre looking for hookers avoid this place after 1am,3
good atmosphere reasonably priced attentive staff can get busy,4
riki and john are two of the best bartenders in vegas the bar is loud fun and great drinks,4
another disappointment in a meat market here in las vegas they dont even butcher their own meat they are no better than a supermarket and not as good as whole foods i would love to find a true butcher here in las vegas,0
so yall know i already hate walmart now my aunty scheduled these family photos with them and these people closed down with no notice not a phone call or anything but they went ahead and collected the money for our photos in advance to say i am pissed does not begin to cover it,0
why didnt i go to kmart  filthy bathroom already been hit up for money  total lack of customer service  in fact i like to call their customer service department lack of customer service  the works always looked over worked and annoyed to have to answer a question or help  i mean the nerve of me,0
room was oknothing special staff was nice parking garage was very spooky pools were not impressive to me there is an adult store right across the streetweird  creepy very convenient location but i wont stay here again,1
excellent lunch buffet  amazing food  great service  clean  reasonably priced kids had never tried indian food until today and loved it  will definitely be back,4

i have never ever not enjoyed myself at petras its grown up  sexy 21  up the atmosphere  ambiance are on point and its generally just the perfect place for a night out great date night place for an intimate experience especially for lgbt but i think anyone could enjoy themselves here,4
my wife and i are late 30searly 40s and did not find him particularly funny nor talented  we went for free on fillaseatcom and ended up leaving about 30 minutes in  sure there were a few funny bits but overall his impersonations were not very good and his jokes were not very funny  skip this one,0
koi crispy rice and sparkling sake,4
this place closed down now it is a thai basil,4
the room is expensive and the service is sosonnthe room service didnt make the room and the room service soup was overly saltynnbeen to vegas many times and have stayed here a couple of times  the casino itself is nice but they could definitely improve their room service,1
the room hugennthe wifi slownnthe location goodnnthe room service decentnnthe wallpaper peelingnnthe bed comfortablennthe sheets scratchynnthe staff smiling with clenched teethnnthe sofa semen stained,3
good hotel for batchlorette parties the suits are nice the extra room when sharing a room with four girls is a luxury,3
it wasnt terrible but the quality for the price was unreasonable husband had macadamia but crusted halibut with orange ginger sauce he said it was very orangey and overall bland i had the kings combo platter the fish was excellent the scallops and shrimp were not bad,0
the best buffalo chicken wings in town who could have imagined that a fish place would have amazing wings they bake them first and then flash fry them you gotta try them,4
no longer open for lunch,2
i ordered a regular7695 big kahuna cheese steak to go it has grilled onions peppers mushrooms jalapenos and extra cheese it was really good the bread wasnt even soggy and it took me 20 minutes to get home,3
funny the same stuff gets executed much better here than in atlantas nw location which i reviewed a few weeks ago  service was fine here too,2
service was slowno refills never checked back had to wait for checknnpizza was pretty good crispy toppingsnnparking was not too bad park around the cornernntoo bad for the awful service here maybe they need to switch to placing your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food servers,0
whenshe told me that the oven is 2000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes i should have hung up the phone by the time i got it home it was rubbery is that a word anyway yuck we wont be back,0
friendly comfortable and food was great would have given 5 stars if they had wine or beer but they said they were working on that,3
great deep dish pizza and this is from an ex chicagoan  casual surroundings and pleasant servers  their salads are xl and recommend the house dressing  deep dishes naturally take longer to make so call in and order before you show up even for dine in,4
i come to las vegas once a year and this is the only place i go to for pizza  the atmosphere and service are great and the food delicious,4
was really looking forward to eating here but was so disappointed i ordered chicken marsala and i got chicken swimming in basically soup it was just terrible guess i should have stuck with the pizza,1
pizza was good a little pricy for pizza hubby was disappointed they dont serve beer or coffee decent service just wasnt expecting to spend 100 on wings and 2 pizzas,2
my favorite local wine shopgreat people great staff and great wine i think everyone should check it outworth the drive to lovely cave creek,4
we ordered the mixed seafood platter but found that it had been too deep fried and therefore too heavy for us we should have ordered something like a grilled fish friends of ours rave about this restaurant so well have to try it again and next time be more selective about what we order,1
if you have a spare 100 and are not real hungry go here long waitpoor service very average food at best but hard to tell when it comes out cold,0
live this place my favorite thing to have here is blackened puerto rican mahi its so tastyim only allowed to eat fish once a week but if i could i would eat here everyday,4
the food was not only fresh and amazing but the service was 10 star worthy our server matt went above and beyond and above again to make sure our experience was top notch,4
i love how late this place opens as most places are in vegas lots of taiwanese food but unfortunately the food tastes soso the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu a dish very hard to find in the southeast,2
nice employees salad bar is good deserts are ok but damn for almost 1200 i could have had a better meal at dennys which is where i will go next time i think i want to eat here,0
not a lot of options as far as food on top of that you can tell the food has been sitting there for hours yuck id enjoy my mcdonalds meal better then this joint service is also lacking where the heck is management cause youve got workers just standing and chit chatting,0
great place to get cold drinks and really good bar food bartenders are amazing and always friendly plenty of tvs to catch any game you wish cant go wrong here,3
i came here as a party 9 service was terrible i was getting up to get utensils and to pour the water the pastries are excellent though but you should just pick them up next door btw the croque monsieur is way too heavy too much cheese you can get a better one at mon ami gabi,0
some of the best pizza i have found since moving out to las vegas,4
too bad close by and after reading other reviews just called and tried to book an appointment and couldntnnnot a big fan of giving out my name phone number and credit card to someone ive never met or a place ive never been,0
just a shout out for ginger luke and the outstanding creativity she has for designing hair she is the only one that my 15 yr old daughter madisson will let touch her hair  thanks for listening and loving what you do,4
dont go here the bartenders are rude,0
excellent tritip quesadilla and brisket  toodiefor sweet biscuits and honey butter  good chicken  steer clear of the sweet potato side dish and what a waste of a roasted artichoke,2
amazing food  the beef ribs and southern fried chicken are so good,4
lots of hands on stuff to do and explore my faves  the robots  they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey fun and informative way to kill an afternoon,3
this place is great local hang out and cold beer everytime the tortilla soup is to die for go endless always a good happy hour monday thru friday  and fun to watch nfl games,4
went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending burgers and drinks were good i wish i had time to sit there and savor it nni will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know,2
i still love this place after all of these years its so nice to stop by and grab a cold one  i did while i waited for another show to start its such a great spot for people watching as well i am glad that through all the changes at ph this is something that has not changed,3
i like the beer the food is ok the chicken sandwich was good i think it is  a little pricey but a decent deal during happy hour one of the better places in chandler to have a beer for sure,3
beer wasnt great and the menu was pretty lame i expected a much better menu very disapointing gordon beirsch looks like fine dinning in comparison i wont be back,1
love this place we drive 50 miles from anthem just for the beer and food great selecton of craft beers and the nacaroni with brisket is to die for,4
stuffed bacon cheeseburger with pretzel bun was great the atmosphere was good but it was a little warmer than what i feel is comfortable service was average overall a good experience will likely go back at some point,3
this is a great find and a wonderful value  ive been participating in this coop for 3 months now and have never been disappointed  my kids always have good snacks and ive found more reasons to cook fresh,4
i ate here for lunch a saturday  the food was good and fresh for 15 all youu can eat the price was just right i like the deco it was like a chic restaurant less like a buffet i give it  3 stars in comparison to the 5 star seafood village buffet at rio,2
this is by far my favorite buffet in las vegasnnthey have a smaller variety of food compared to other buffets that i have been to but its still totally worth it nnthe dessert section is the best they have a wide variety of sweets ice cream cotton candy and even chocolate covered strawberries d,4
the only reason i came here was because the ti provided us with a 2 for 1 coupon the food was over cooked and greasy and some just tasted funny the desserts were the only things that we ok not horrible but not great either very disappointing,1
mastros serves up the best steak in scottsdale  they also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes  prices are steep after 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddys,4
ive got to be honest and say i went for their bread basket  best ever went on my birthday two years in a row  first year everything was 5 star second year must have hit an off night  poor service and mediocre food except for the bread,2
mastros has a reputation for being the best in phoenix and they did not disappoint i had the salmon not a big fan of steak and it was excellent as were the shoestring fries,4
new ownership doesnt get it,0
love the freshness of the ingredients  makes it a weekly trip for menthe desserts are my favorite though  the burritos are overstuffed so i have never actually eaten a whole burritos yet,3
people were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried  we didnt experience much laughter or tears  not sure if it was because we could not relate to it  this show is for 45,1
what a disappointment  everything was overly salted including the miso soup  and it certainly was not worth the 50 per plate  we wont be back,1
seen this show more than a dozen times in the span on 3 years and its always fun  naughty,3
we loved dat phan was hilarious,4
this was a great show wally the mc was the highlight worth the price i loved every minute,4
reminded me of the days of the ed sullivan show a series of acts assembled to create a full show  all were enjoyable,3
good  decent lunch specials however i had to knock a couple stars because waitress came to our table at least 3 times  did not bother to fill water glasses and we had to remind her for our roll that comes with lunch entreu00e8 fish was ok not that fresh,2
oyshis ayce sushi experience is kind of well meh  it is neither exciting nor disappointing  i felt that the fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was a little ricehappy  the rolls were not too exciting  i would go back but only if someone else insisted,2
fish was decent a little warm for my taste service is good i feel with the business they do that they can upgrade some of their products such as buying better soy sauce then higher quality of fish,2
honestly its a really nice place with nice decor  i guess thats why people think that the food is good  actually the food i was not impressed at all  the rolls the appetizers  but hey again nice restaurant,0
great as usual can never get enough of this place love the all you can eat sushi and appetizers,4
this is the 2nd time weve come early enough but the hostess didnt want to seat us so we are going elsewhere  300 tab  your loads mutha fuckas,0
finally a place that advertises spanish sausage and doesnt hand me a mexican chorizo i enjoyed a very nice lunch sitting on the back patio the other day i ordered the cheese and sausage panini the service was very friendly and i left much happier than when i arrived,3
great food and a comfortable bar area even with kids,3
yummy food good price,3
best gyro ive had in az,4
good for a quick lunch big variety vitamin selection is ok seems overpriced,3
i expected more wolf howling at the moon shirts sorely disappointed,2
the ambiance was nice but the bartenders were rude we were handed our drinks and never heard from our bartender herbie again whats the point of looking at something nice if the service is poor pretty on the outside ugly on the inside,0
overpriced only went because we had a coupon  service was ok but not overly friendly either  definitely dont need to go back,1
is it a steakhouse or a singles bar  with the music blasting out of the bar area it is difficult to tell  there are steak options every few blocks here in the valley of the sun so skip this one and go to any of the other fine options,1
absolutely wonderful  the food is amazing the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is trendy and inviting would definitely recommend,4
food and service was good not great but  certaintly not memorable the noise level is horrendous with the waitress having to almost yell to describe the specialsetc this was in the dining room too not in the bar also the table are way too close together better places can be had nearby,2
a month later a manager called me from mastros apologized and informed me that they updated their music   he told me he was sending me a coupon or voucher to make up for the bad experience and bad food but 3 weeks later have not received anything  city hall again has dropped the ball,0
i was really disappointed with my foods and services we came in at 150 pm and waited for 15 mins just to order our drinks and we didnt get our food till 1 hour laterand waited for 40mins for him to stop by so i can request for our check this is ridiculous if i can give negative stars i would,0
thank you for saving our christmas meal ingredient scavenger hunt stay open on christmas and save more dinners,4
lasagna come here for the lasagna i always order an extra side of their meat sauce its so tasty you will want to add more of it to the lasagna  for a quick homemade neighborhooditalian meal this place cannot be beat and i am very picky,4
this is the best target in vegas ive been to 6 and this store is great staff are friendly returns are easy clearance is regularly cheaper than other area targets the only thing missing is a starbucks please please put one in,4
the cashier here is very mean especially a lady named letticia,0
the pickle that comes with food here is about the only thing worth writing about otherwise everything is just kind of boring and not worth the trip there are so many other good places to get a sandwich or salad that are far superior skip this place and try somewhere else,1
this place is very loud and the staff are not friendly  the food is ok and the drinks are pretty plain,0
chef salad was delicious and quickly prepared great attitude from employees order was perfect open till 10pm for late time dinner,4
i wish i could give 0 stars nni went back today to give them another try the service was so disgusting i walked out before getting my food nnso disgusted by them beware you will get treated like absolute shit,0
my mother and i ate here last sunday afternoonexcellent panang curry  pad thai it was not greasy at all had an excellent flavor i ordered spice level 7 and loved it i like it spicy  the atmosphere was also very nice,3
large portions great quality lots of options henderson location is awesome the fact that they have multiple locations is even more awesome ni would say that pinkaows traditional thai dishes are comparable to lotus of siams and that they are simply just less busy,4
not bad  the formats pretty similar to chipotle where you go up and order and pay at the register at the end  the prices are a bit higher but the food tastes better  the chicken salad was huge  the tortillas are freshly made  the place is clean and spacious  the employees are friendly too,3
a great selection of brews and scotchwhisky paired with finest mediocre pub fare leave the fancy cousine and drinks to hannys and grab yourself some fish  chips with a dram of lagavulin 16 oh i forgot to mentiontheyre cigar friendly,2
10 for a 420pm show the absolute worst movie theater popcorn i have ever eaten i wish id have gone a few miles out of the way to amc for 5 tickets and good popcorn very very disappointing visit,1
great popcorn and an extremely friendly staff  seats are comfortable and the theatre is clean,4
nothing exceptional yet no terrible disappointments an abuelos clone for sure dont go outta your way,2
when this first opened the food was good now it tastes like everything came from the freezer the food is just okay now but not for the price,1
have to bring this down  place was cool but the staff became really shtty  i so like the food but geez its smile or something,2
i was in town visiting a friend and he said this was a good local bar where we could have a couple beer and play a game of poker i wish there were something like that in oc apparently they have a huge soccer followingwe were there in january a good time,3
they always put a lot of effort into this exhibit and considering its a free attraction that says a lot about bellagio on the weekend it can get quite crowded  its a small area  but definitely worth seeing if you are in the area,3
same as it ever wasnsame as it ever wasnsame as it ever wasnn talking headsnnyeah not much had changed in the 24 years that passed between my last two visits you get a burger thats a little charred fries and onion rings are fairly good the atmosphere is without pretension,2
this used to be the original location of nypd pizza but the owners sold it to pauly and the food has gone downhill sincenill stick with nypd pizza thank you very much,1
i was only outside but the outside was beautiful a little confusing to drive around but a ton of little restaurants and shops super cute,3
i stopped 2 bjs to fill app for bartender i talked to a manager with in 10 mins that was the best interview i have had i have been a casino for 25  yrs it was a very well conducted i am very impressed n       bob nichols,4
outfit to rock on the strip this hm was pretty much one of my favorite stores layout was great and their selection was very trendy,4
this food was pretty terrible and overpriced  i would not go back,0
worse buffet experience in vegas usually you can never go wrong with buffets in vegas this was a bad choice nnfood section quality was bad overpriced nnnever come here again,1
short review dorm food,1
wish this site had a minus star  this buffet was terrible  the food was mediocre food stations were dirty and not well stocked the salad bar was the biggest disappointment   certainly not worth the 20 dinner price  i would not recommed this to anyone,0
no its not mgm or mandalay bay it is a good buffet for the money the lunch buffet had a lot of good options they have middle eastern asian mexican italian and american standards for 35 you can get three buffets in a day i wouldnt suggest it but you could,2
i had fun here while i was in search of an inexpensive brunch before the long drive home great variety of dishes one step up from the hometown buffetgolden corral type buffets,2
horrible the chicken tastes like its from a banquet tv dinner do not waste your money like we wasted ours,0
this is absolutely abysmal im sitting at the table trying to figure out how to get my money back,0
formerly pharoahs pheast  definately spacious dining area  but the food was just ok,1
not the same any more use to be called the pharohs feast and its called the more buffetshould be call the less buffeti use to like the fresh fruits now they offer canned fruits waste of my 20 bucks the waffle was so hard i could hv used it for a sponge to wash my dishes yuck,0
avoid it reminds me of a hometown buffet chain the food is plentiful as is the selection and some of the items are good but the it comes off as a cheap cafeteria it looks old and run down and some of the food looks like its been sitting there forever,1
first to review now the lastnstopped by to see hiro and shige at shiro sushi last night and there is a note on the doornncouldnt make it through the slow timesnntoo badnhopefully we will find them elsewhere soonntj,0
chad at the bar hates his job he made that obvious through his poor service and bad attitude our crime eating dinner and buying drinks,1
service at the las vegas blvd location is always horrible except for the bar area for some apparent reason i continue coming great bar food awesome beer,1
worst customer service ever the hostess was more then rude  spoke to us like we were stupid  the manager was clueless,0
this is a outdoor shopping area  great shops  beautiful spot to stop for brunch and then go shopping  great addition to vegas to get away from the strip,3
a few excellent shops and some good food movie theatre its a suburban commercial center you should know these places as they are everywhere carbon copied in any city but this is a really nice one,3
lots of shops but some are too expensive for me great place to walk around they do have a kids playground which is nice frys is next close by there is a movie theater which is way to pricey,3
perfect for date night town square is easy to get to lots of parking spaces great shopping great bars restaurants and a theaternnkinda has a cali feel to it outdoor mall with palm trees everywhere only thing missing is the weather,4
wow horrible counter staff rude unhelpful just awful why cant rick bayless have more outlets this is bad,0
this place has the best grilled chicken greek salad and sauce i havent found a better greek restaurant in phoenix give it a try and youll see how good it is ive been there 6 times and each time the food earned 5 stars its that good,4
great spot food ok staff does try but not the bestlove the views and the room,2
nearly all of the staff seemed incompetent and slow had to walk out of the cafe because we didnt get service our room service order was completely screwed up and they never fixed it the trash in the hallways hasnt been picked up for days nobody was at the gift shop or the spa,0
closed for ever,0
good food girl is not too friendly  unless your turkishnsmall portions large prices not enough hummus or babagounish veggie platter price keeps going up with all the other prices really good food just skimpy on things and prices are very expensive for this kind of fast food,2
eat first before you gonok food but kid portions spent 90 for a family of four and left hungrynadded insult is 18 mandatory tip for parties of 4 or more i thought the irs changed the rule about thatnso in short first and last time,0
great place gotta have nick as your chef we had dinner real late and service was awesome everything there is good from chicken to the lobster to the sake you will have a great time just watch your wallet cause it can get expensive lol,4
this place is great for large groups  their happy hour the separate room for teppanyaki is nice  the food tastes great its a bit pricey but definitely worth it,3
the owner likes butcher your haircut and color then likes to argue with you on whether or not you lied to her about how you wanted your hair not worth the price or the time  beware,0
disappointing color was not done well thus expensive for the results   ngray was not covered friendly clean,1
margarita in a cup for 16 dollars i would rather just get a fat tuesday nnnthe watermelon margarita was really good though but im not sure if she added alcohol,2
came in at 700 pm saturday night  place is clean    waitresses were slow handling to many tables eachn30 minute ticket times   food was average    ill skip next time,1
i miss this restaurant so much their tortilla soup and jerk chicken salad speaks to my soul i recommend trying these two items because they are delicious while i enjoy the scottsdale location the tempe one is nice too,2
love happy hour  love the cleanliness of the place  love the friendly servers  love the bloody mary bar on sunday mornings  love  love  love  and dont get me started on the chambord margaritas  drink one  youre welcome,4
solidnim not in love with the food but it serves a purpose  my hubby loves the cornbread so we usually end up here versus kona based on the bread alone,2
foods recommendedtejas trio catfish tacos smothered chicken burrito an more my wife and i come here often and love the food the margaritas are real good but real strong nnonly downside is the patio good people watching but its in basically a parking garage nnall in all you cant go wrong here,4
simply delicious foodgreat food and love the ambience as it is in the fashion square mall i cant get enough of this mexican food also have drink specials during happy hour time love it love it love it you cannot miss this place for its fajitas,4
came here today got seated by the host and never got service after about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave maybe we smelled bad  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated,0
found this place on yelp while vacationing in vegas yay vegas im really glad we drove out of our way for this one because its worth the 30 mins drive and some  our faves include the spicy mexican roll big island roll fried oysters and the garlic tuna,3
island sushi  is the best  great customer service  best place for eat all you can sushi,4
fish not fresh tuna frozen  ebi from same frozen shrimp i buy from 99 ranch market  sushi is bad service was really bad never going back,0
so its been over two years since i tried this place the service has gotten better the takeout food has gotten a little better the sushi was still crapnnthe poke was actually edible and it didnt smell like spoiled fish nnwish i could give it better stars but the food is still marginal at best,1
quite disappointed my green beans had worms in them customer service was bad still charge me full price for everything nobody even apologized it was just a plain horrible experience,0
absolutely terrible food paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me the wait staff are superb and very nice the orleans has other places to eat on site so avoid this one at all cost,0
pretty awful bad service  dirty crowded hot and the food is junk  i should have gone to another terminal,0
beer was not very cold  they dont have the beer price on the menu  it is more than youd or id expectnni went there expecting some custom beer  not here  standard beers on tap,1
apathetic service not a brewing company just a bar  pass this one by,0
darn it all this time i was excited to have found a clothing brand that actually had a branch back home in the bay until i found out that the local store has now closed fcuk m l  sigh if only i couldnnwell at least i have an excuse to go back to las vegas for yet another weekend of debauchery,4
this place is a wonderfull place to go to inexpensive and very friendly bartenders and some sexy ones at that woo hoo love the screens in there and the food is excellent,3
i wish i could give this place more stars but like everyone says its over price slow service and the food is only ok you are better off going to the starbucks in the hotel and getting a muffin,1
4 stars just for the face this joint as frozen margaritas and beers for 200  nthat alone is 4 stars  didnt eat but sat at the bar alone with a few drinks  nice bartender  will go back again when in town  hard to find 200 drinks on the strip,3
if your restaurant closes at 10 pm then why cant i order fried rice togo at 930 thats absolutely ridiculous i work in the industry and we would never turn away business because we are getting ready to close extremely rude job hostess,0
this place sucks was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge sat at a dirty table only one available and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left never again,0
i have family out in vegasand its a must to stop by when we come into in the middle of our stay and right before we leave carne asada fries are the shit the shrimp burrito is pretty gnarly too,4
the ambiance makes it seem like a fancy restaurant but sadly it is not the food reminds me of mexican fast food joints like chilis or chevys same kind of appetizers and everything the service is good though,1
i will never eat or drink at this location the waitress took 30 minutes to take my order and the cook handled all kinds of raw food without ever changing his gloves,0
i enjoyed the novelty of getting my mercury on for 3 in a big cup the shrimp were of poor quality  of that i am sure  but love the concept and they tasted decent,2
this place is wonderful fat free  new clean place plenty of parking  nice staff  and did i say fat free  great spot,3
free entrance  free champagne all night for ladieshuka section dance section and 2 bars the rooms are dark and sexy what more could you ask for  enough saidnnhowever 2 well drinks26 bucks ouch,4
whenever youre in vegas make sure to hit up this place  i strongly suggest getting the bottle service and if you do holla at my friend shannon belshoy bottle agent she is very courteous and professional good times,4
we got in for freeit wannso i started to write this review months ago and i never finishednwell i am proud to announce that i have made table reservations for june so apperently i like this place cant wait to go and act a fool,3
dont waste your time or your money on this place they dont care about good customer service or long waits they only care about their repeat customers i wanted to make this my sunday place since i too am from chicago but the service was horrible and the food was no better than ihop,0
ehhhh im underwhelmednnon a scale of 110 i give it a cnnbecause that is how much sense it makes to not make an amazing scrabbled eggnntried this place twicennfool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me,1
is this in california too if not it should be it was amazing and delicious,3
creative food poor service nspent close to an hour between appetizers and the main entries,2
this place was good for the view  the drinks  the light show  and boo calling  heck ya i got hammered and liked it,3
cheap beer and interesting crowd that go there its in freemont  downtown,1
i went in today to purchase a desk and the staff here was really helpful the only problem i had was trying to track someone down to help me they even put the package in my car for me service was excellent but i felt they could have more staff on the floors,3
stop here almost every time we are in vegas jello shots and redbull vodkas we usually see the same bartenders too which is nice good service,3
i hate the marathon every year it ruins my life for one day i live in tempe and there is nothing greater than shutting down all the roads near my place and then having to battle with the increased traffic at least its only once a year ahhhhhh i forgot about ironman,0
very clean fair price for the quality food and ingredients simple menu good cheesesteaks and fries be aware of the cheese fries as they use real thick cheese  it may be a little overwhelming overall very good restaurant we will return,3
i had the jambalaya and it was very good gf had the fish and pasta she loved it only problem was that we sat outside and a bee was bothering usnnotherwise the drinks are great the food was plentiful and the atmosphere was very calm,3
first time ever eating here got a gyro salad for lunch its huge only 695 and a great fast meal nnother stuff looks iffy so eat at your own risk,3
did not honor website prices overcharged on a la carte lunch specials and charged extras without warnings and every table was available at noon coincidence i think not  what happened to the restaurant that was here under the same name a year ago,0
this place was amazing i loved the decor it felt very warm and welcoming i dont know why people are giving this place such a bad review this is going to by our new spot for dates and dinner we were so happy with how friendly our server was we gave him a 20 tip that never happens,4
went once las fuentas is sooooo much better no need to go back here,1
my girlfriend and i have been there twice and twice we have gotten upset stomachs there were green bugs in the menus friendly people but get passed off to a different person both times stay away from this place,0
we found this place based on an ad online for 2 off a smoothie it was hot like hell so we stopped by we got 2 smoothie and they only took 2 off we asked about it the girl said she did not know and gave an awkward smile false advertising i do not like dishonest business,0
omg this is seriously my favorite place to eat on mill i love that you can get a super tasty burrito quickly and hang out and have a drink at the bar and they are really cheap i would highly recommend the pork its shredded and has a nice kick to it,4
the crowd was all old creepy drunk men  one was drooling and bragging about how much money he had and then got kicked out bc he stole my friends iphone music was so loud i couldnt think bartender was awesome though,1
just great to have a nice momentnnbroad selection of wine ask for alexs advice he is surely one of the best sommelier you will ever meetnnwe will go back no doubt about it,4
the best steak ive had at a restaurant period i ordered the grass fed new york strip medium rare yes they have grass fed beef and organic pastured chickens here nnwith a great view of the strip and outside balcony seating morels french steakhouse is vegas dinner must,4
the bread is not warm the half oyster plate had one empty shell so we got 5 oysters total we ordered the bone in new york steak ive definitely had better at lesser restaurants the service is excellent but the food did not hit the spot,2
this is definitely one of my favorite places in vegas its a steakhouse however we never tried the steak there we always go with the seafood and french onion soup,4
good prices on a lot of cool stuff    the sweets and snacks were on sale 3 for 2 bought some pizza flavored gamer grub here and its great  now i dont have to eat all that greasy food whilst i pvpnngreat selection of cool stuff and friendly helpful staff,3
worst chinese buffet ive had in town got a flyer in the mail and the picture and price was attractive and decided to give it a try it was a big disappointment food did not taste good alot of dried up dishes the place is in desperate need of remodeling would not come back,0
i had a chocolate cupcake from this today and currently am suffering from food poisoning i suspect that its salmonela  i threw up everything that was inside me and still cant move and have a crazy headache  watch out when eating their cupcakes,0
i took my kids to the cupcakery and i joyed the cupcakes the only problem is the price of the cupcakes i paid 500 for one cup cake that was to much i ended up buying four cupcakes not to say that i did not enjoy eating the cupcake but it was overpriced,3
great price for the breakfast deal 499 chicken steak  eggs friendly staff good food and price music is little loud but it is a bar what can you say right,4
love this store whether to purchase stuff or just get some good ideas on how to decorate  the staff is always super nice and helpful and always have lots of great stuff in stock,3
yes this store is absolutely beautiful  the handbags department is huge  ask for my friend amanda shell help you out  nnext time i win big at the tables im gonna shopnthis store beats the hell out of suks  needless markup thats off the strip,4
its not about the atmosphere really its the food they give you comp chips with guacamole salsa and bean dip all so very good wedsun they have a 995 lunch special that includes a 2 item combo fideo soup also yum and a frozen margarita you cant beat that,4
mediocre food salsa tasted too tomatoy guacamole was very bland taquitos were just ok much better food from the small holeinthewall mexican joints,1
yaaawwwwwnnn nextnthere are better pizza joints in town,1
if i wasnt trying to cut back on carbs id be there more regularly but i love this place  everything on the menu is yummy service is a bit rushed on a friday night but thats to be expected in a good restaurant here in town definitely recommend humble pie its delish,3
one of the better pizzas ive had in phx sry dominos,3
great salad fast service and respectable pizza  the bar setting makes this a welcoming hangout,3
the only good thing about this place is getting to ride the mechanical bull  it was empty both nights we stopped by  at least i get to mark something off my bucket list,2
i like this place  it is in the top 5 places to get a great burger in charlotte  they have lots of cool signature choices and of course you can create one any way you like  they have great fries both reguar potato and sweet potato,2
excellent burger sweet potatoes were also awesome  price was a little bit high but the food was excellent,3
these people here are retards caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk i think lifes gonna be a long road for him,0
i often stop in this place when im at tempe marketplace to get a drink and relax  they usually have some decent drink specials and they have a nice big bar  the bartenders usually take a little effort to order from not really sure why that is maybe i just have bad luck,2
had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months laterdefinitely not going back here,0
went here early sunday the food was greatdrinks the hostess and servers where perfect young and energetic  sat at the large patio great weather,4
this place was horrible do not go here,0
love the ice cream and the mixins are fantastic but hate the hours of operation,3
temples 1year anniversary last wednesday was great  all the regulars plus a ton of people that come from time to time  it was a good time crowded but not too much so never an issue getting a drink  and those free beers until 8 kindof snuck up on me  dangerous midweek,4
tots tots tots what else can you ask for oh yeah best beer selection at this local spot the staff is friendly and the food is delish overall a very satisfied customer  somebody beer me,4
golden corral has better quality food,0
waited here twenty minutes for service waiter came and got our drink order and they were never brought to us my boyfriend and i just ended up leaving terrible service,0
the service is fine better to go in during happy hour n dont miss their seafood undo pasta yum,2
found a bug in my salad see picture,0
excellent service good ambiance the sushi here was above average with decent size rolls and nigiri i gave 4 stars because the price was very reasonable,3
ive eaten a ton of thai foodno like a ton of a thai food there is a place to get thai on every corner in chicago i have to say the flavor was very bland nothing that made it memorable the service was great but again the dishes were just bland,2
very good food great flavors and amazing bread very friendly staff too,4
good food good portions good price,4
the food is decent but it gets spendy quickly  their oj is the bestfresh squeezed most breakfast items are very good service is good  the tri tip dip is a must try,2
love our family ymca the new teen center is also very cool since they have pac man the original yes i move kids out of the way to play lol,4
the salad was average but the salmon was awful it was over priced for what you get and how you get it cafeteria style,0
like the convenience and prices on some items disappointing that they dont take manufacturer coupons  some items are missing low cal low carb etc,2
frankly it was delicious a carnivores dream,4
weve been here several times now and have not been disappointed yet  its always fun and the food is always good,4
not much meat selection  really slow  even thoughi wasnt crowded  the meat was really some poor cuts ie sirloin   the salad bar was boring i have to say i came here about a year ago and was really impressed,1
enjoyed the coffee did not care for atmosphere,2
they feature a different black coffee each day  super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where its from great vibe for business or catching up with friends,4
the coffee is fine  i am very thrown by the fact the dont have any center or sugar for taking   their poor costumer service skills is the single reason i do nor plan on caffinate here again  they yell at their customers which is just poor business altogether,1
cute modern coffee warehouse type cafe building good baristas and coffee a great place to chill and enjoy a espresso with friends,3
i love the food here you can make your own stuff combination veggies and stuff  delicious the food is greatnnthe service however could be better faster and more attentivennronney,2
very disappointed went there on a saturday night they said the were down 2 chefs it took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out the food was hot so thats why i gave a 1 star ill never visit this place again id rather go to ycs,0
every time i visit pittsburgh i have to stop here ive ordered a few sandwiches but just like everyone says everything is good only down side is that service is a little slow,3
besides having a starbucks in here this is one of the best places to stop and get a peace of mind away from the hustle and bustle,3
the curry is amazing some of the best curry we have had on the east side the pumpkin curry is ubertasty as is the mango curry go for the currynnonly downside that the appitizers while tasty are quite small so just stick with the curry,3
its was ok not really worth all the hypennprice a lotnpresentation goodntaste okaynservice okay,1
have visited twice  second time was better than the first  nothing memorable though  steak was cooked perfectly  good flavor  would recommend but try cut first  i need to try again though a lot of good reviews about the dry aged here  it wont disappoint but may leave you wanting more,2
the beet ravioli was gross my hubbys steak needed salt and service was slow at least the waiter comped the ravioli since he was the one who suggested it wont be back,0
i have been back two more times since my first visit and have had excellent service and an excellent meal each time  we always order the riserva steak and we are always happy  it seems like hit or miss with other reviewers here but so far i cant speak highly enough of this place,4
you didnt offer a zero this place has good food but is overpriced and the music they pipe in that prohibits conversation should get someone an opportunity in another industry,0
always good food and wine here tonight we each had the green salad with beets my wife added grilled nc shrimp an 8 add on nicely prepared and flavored i had the salad without any add ons but i once again succumbed to the sliders done perfectly  we left with a smile on on faces,3
foodstaff  service all very very poorinteriors very depressingu are better of cooking indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place,0
i have visited indian paradise on several more occasions since my first visit the food remains very good as well as the service prices have gone up a bit but is still good value for the money try the lunch time buffet  great variety and the food is fresh and well priced,3
tandoori chicken and chicken madras is really good,4
superb place and superb food,3
went for my first time to the lunch buffer  it was fabulous  great food worth the 11,4
very good meal  a la carte dinner and service above and beyond must go back for the buffet,3
i was taken here by my family for my birthday and was treated like royalty by the staff great selection great food wr had a very enjoyable evening,4
amazing dinner experience we had dinner on christmas night set menu that evening with choice of wine pairing the meal was glorious especially the chestnut soup with scallops service was spoton we had a wonderful evening and cant wait to return,4
the food is good but if your eating in the bar bring a fan  it is way to hot  there is no ac  pathetic,1
the burger was good the fries were ok but once you mentally process that they were deep fried in lard then what was tasting really good turned into a really guiltloaded dinner but it is what it says it is a truly american restaurant proud of its decadence,2
so fattening so unhealthy so delicious it was worth the drive from la to az,4
really good food i am surprised to hear about poor service as our server was friendly and our food came out super fast we will definitely be back,3
im here almost every saturday and i always bring friends the barista are great the regulars are relaxed the drinks are carefully made and delicious and the atmosphere is perfect,4
was a regular for a while over time found the friendliness from the staff to be a bit of an act zombie hipsters long wait,1
there isnt a coffee shop at the address given in yelp i called the number but couldnt reach them,0
stopped in with a friend of mine on a busy night even though busy we were greeted and helped by a very friendly sales associate the store was kept neat and tidy especially considering its the holiday shopping season i would definitely visit this location again,3
i walked out 123014 230 pm in disgust after female server tried to seat me in a tiny booth even though there were many bigger booths and tables available asked to talk to manager but told he wasnt available,0
best sandwiches anywhere everything is made fresh and is outstanding my favorite is the turkey bacon avocado amazing even the sides are made fresh daily the potatoes salad is out of this world goodnyou got to try this place,4
this is one of the most conveniently located costcos in the valleynnyou are walking distance from a super walmart and a super target and even a movie theaternnthis costco is always crowded not just on the weekends,4
rude service  very unpleasant order takers  plus bagels are just as bad as eating doughnuts,0
i went on a week night so didnt have the issues some have had with service  the place was dead  i thought the sushi was ok but it could have been better  prices were a bit steep compared to other places i have been  2 sets of rolls and a beer was 30  i could get more for less,2
this place is pretty good not the best but its still satisfying,2
after posting this i went in and asked for a cash refund as i was not interested in returning and would not use a credit  as mentioned by the owner i was given the cash refund i requested  i stand by all my other statements,0
when the owner comes by to apologize its not a good night service is slow pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie its also weirdly loud in there,1
slow service very small pour for overpriced winelove the rustica pizza i like to carry out garlic knots and a rustica from their tatum location for some reason no garlic knots at the location on indian bend,1
im a little bit disappointed  i tried to order a smaller custom cake for a very special occasion  even though i inquired over 3 weeks in advance they declined because theyre too busy,0
i like their food but there are some annoying flies bothering us,2
only korean place well go in town our favs include seafood pancake bugolgi seafood tofu soup,3
this place was ok live music patio bar the inside where the live music was being played smelled like cheseraunchyidfk but it was not hotnnndrink specials were ok havent had the food yet too smelly to eat inside,2
good local spot tucked away beyond the strip small dance floor hookahs live bands are just a few things that they have to offer,3
what a relief to have found this place ion a late night shortly after arriving sin city the guacamole that they actually make at your table  is a must the food was great  so was the service my only complaint is the volume of the music please take it down a notch,3
tried various locations of lindo around town just not impressed just standard fare with inflated prices,1
decent c,2
great service and foodnnlove the staff and the place,4
pretty place but snotty management and the cocktails are not very good after being told that a booth was reserved we were invited to sit with a large corporate group which was so kind of them that reserved table never became filled,1
i dont really care what the overall stars rating is this place is greatnthe shepards pie is one of the best in the valley and the staff is always ready with a fresh pintnthe sunday jam sessions for traditional music is great,4
great foodfresh beer and great service on a busy saturday night  the band was real good too,4
pure charm in every way and a perfect kitchen  fantastic bartender  its one of the valleys best,4
amazing food and cocktails the music is to die for if you are a reggae fan like mena perfect meal,4
happy hour for drinks nice ambience and super customer service and salt fish fritter i didnt give 5 star due to not trying actual food but great overall,3
an interesting concept  all items nicely packaged  self checkout that works well  would return,3
i always make a stop at dsw also at this locationnthe location is great and you have a very nice variety of shoesnthere are lots of parking placesnarea around is quite convenient you have a lot of other stores like target etcnon the other site of the parking spot you find place to hang around,4
good beer good food good music good people,4
if i could eat the pepper jack mac and cheese all day long i would i get it every time i go the sandwiches are pretty good too its got a great laid back atmosphere where you can get pretty decent bar food and a have a beer or two,2
this place is a dive but is strangely appealing  the food was good and reasonably priced  service was friendly and fast  the outdoor patio is amazing with ping pong and corn hole  they even had a band outside on a wednesday night  great hang out joint  wii definitely be back,3
very unique and authentic breakfast this is not a ihop type everything is made and presented delicately will definitely go back to check out the salads,3
another hidden gem  def need to get anything with sweet potatoes in it,3
cool place great healthy food spotty service,2
consistent eclectic fare at reasonable prices   large portions   i eat mostly breakfast at zjs have tried most of the menu over the years and keep going back   ive even figured out when to arrive so i can park,4
great food great atmosphere but poor customer service  no smiles on the cashiers at all  they just never seem happy to be there,1
pulled pork was tough dry and vinegary  fries were old and soggy,1
ive been thinking to stop by forever so i finally didnnill keep this review short and simple its ok if youre around give it a shot theres not much in that side of the 101 but dont drive more than 2 miles for that just saying,2
used to be a lot of fun but prices went up and service went downnfinding new place to hang out with friends,0
of course my son loved this placennvery clean and lots to look  while no races going on  way to expensive  two races for son 50  wouldnt have gone here  all except that my son really wanted to do this  i would rather spend the money on something else,2
we went to pole position as part of a team building event with work  it was pretty fun definitely a great place to bring out the competitive attitude in everyone,2
stopped by this place on vacation in scottsdale last week  we were just looking for something quick  the pizza was good nothing fantastic but pretty good  i had a slice of pepperoni and olive  the ingredients were all fresh and i enjoyed it  it was very expensive given the location,2
love this place great sushi and korean although i mostly go for the sushi,4
the best korean food in vegas clean and great service a place that i would go back to,4
their iced mocha is really good  im not to big on the bagels thats the only reason i took off a star everything from service to drinks is awesome,3
excellent food and service  they were not that busy when we were there so we had a lot of attention from the wait staffnnlobster mac and cheese was a definite home run,3
service was incredible  we were a group of seven and all were pleased with the food and service provided  we would all definitely recommend and return,3
pretty good and cozy place for casual dinning steak and lobster bisque soup were really great,3
we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the se valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here service was alright but food quality was sub par not returning,0
my question this is a great costco but why do they charge more for gas than any other costco iin the area  overcharging their very good customersni had a pepperone slice  of pizza on saturday but there was no cheese on the pizza just sauce and pepperoni,0
horrible worst service ive ever had slow no check backs no refills asked for one it never came poured water with glasses on the table splashing ever where watched an employee use the bathroom and then not wash hands food was great but cant say ill be back,0
sunday happy hour is so cheap if you come here get the seared salmon roll i dont even care for salmon and its amazing,3
hubby and i went here on a date night sushi was yummy and so were the drinks we went on a busy sat evening and there was a dj so it was a little loud not overbearing though makes for good people watching our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu well definately revisit this one,3
if sushi is what you like visit the geish what i like to call it this is a great place to bring a date the seared salmon special and infused saki are my favorite the vibe is very relaxed and intimate,4
the sushi was so so service was mediocre and the drink hello kitty martini is the furthest thing from a martini ultimately dissatisfied,0
this is my home away from home take out tasty meal the chinese chicken salad is where its at fresh tasty quick ok so sometimes im too lazy to make something healthy so they do it for me eat half now and save the rest for later  2 meals in one and theyre nice too,4
closednnit is close to work so i went back had a hot ham and cheese it was quite good and the service was much better  tried to go back again last week and its closed  no sign emptied out,4
very good food  they just moved locations across the street to the old seesaw location good food cant really choose a bad item however the atmosphere is very ho hum,2
loved it best french toast ever,4
lots of variety of things to get ive only been there the one time but the people i was there with frequent the place and say its hit or miss on service but the food is nearly always delicious,3
service is good food is terrible low quality bad preparation  if the quality to price was more in line i wouldve given it a higher rating because i dont generally have high expectations for chains but in this case i just dont think the value is there,1
used to go there all the time and the last time i went the tech accidentally cut off a chunk of skin which was horribly painful and two days later i found out i had a massive staph infection,0
happy hour 247 cant get better than that and they have a better sushi selection than ra sushi i wish the place was bigger they finally have gift cards and a pearl reviews point card  score,3
sushi is better presented than it tastesnnif you want to mingle with douchebags and douchebaguettes sit outside yes ed hardy is worn en masse out therennits a good deal during happy hour tuesday or with a gift certificate from wwwlocaldinescom remember you can use those gcs on sun through thurs only,2
its a huge slice and a fair price but other than that i dont share the enthusiasm for mamma mias its just ok,2
im tough on pizza places this place is good i truly enjoy the ingredients and preparation atmosphere and service are lacking,2
i love mamma mias and eat there often the pizza is my favorite in town the caesar salad is always fresh and the meatballs rock ive never had any thing there that i didnt enjoy dont miss out,4
i love this movie clean friendly management is always on their employees about customer service they are a bit pricey but worth it i always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick love the shopping and food around it always clean and on time awesome experience,4
i come here a lot like that they have cheap matinees and offer a variety at snack bar like that they have the automated ticket machines,2
location location location charlottes great place to have a glass of wine and people watch dolce vita is located in the queen city best location in town noda great outdoor seating and good wine selection absolutely one of our favorites 4 thumbs up,4
the food deserves an a and should deserve a 5 star the reason i gave it  3 star is because the price from the menu in front of the counter is different than the one from the menu for the customer they try to charge you more about 30 cents more per order therefore i gave them a 3 star instead,2
i love this place in and out in no time the food is very fresh made to order and you can call in your order and come and pick it up ive  tried many rolls all very good,3
i refer to this frys as the nice frys that is a little out of the way but we sometimes go to because its nice,4
this place had terrible service and piss poor food to boot it was a combination of our waitress being new and not interacting well with the chief that cause the bad experience however there are plenty of better italian resturants in vegas than this,0
i love shopping at this store the meat selection is absolutely amazing the customer service is out of this world you have to check it out for yourselves,4
we are very pleased with our new patio security door we now only wish we had done it sooner the entire process was professional including the installation,4
service sucks got our drinks after we got our food the restaurant was not even busy after we got our separate bills our waiter alberto had messed up our orders and proceeded to tell us they did not split checks failed to mention that before end ordered,0
undercooked egg overall very poor,0
glad i only had coffee  meh,1
i took 2 computers within 2 days and both issues were resolved  very nice and explains what the problems were very affordable,4
wasnt impressed at all,1
cafe rio has the best food but this location has not gotten an order correct once when ordering online dont expect your food to be made until you get there make sure to check it or you will get home and find out your order is wrong,0
whats your time worth  dollar doesnt think its worth much  its 1130pm over 40 families are editing in line  with three 3 agents to serve  its a gross display of ignorance  arrogance  i cant ever imagine renting from dollar ever  you shouldnt either  lesson learned,0
good persian food with a courteous staff nice to have in the neighborhood,2
solid persian food  have the beef platter  it comes with some kind of ground beef and sirloin on skewers  served on a bed of saffron rice  its all very delicious and even better the next day  20plate but you can share between 2 people and be full  love the complimentary pita bread,3
very nice a little dated but all in all very nice if only it was closer to my house,3
the service was lousy i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time what,0
the staff here is always extremely friends burgers are very tasty and their milkshakes are to die for  rewind to the scene in pulp fiction where uma thurman asks for a 5 milkshake  there is no bourbon but these are some fine damn milkshakes,3
wow very good well priced  you cant go wrong theres delicious middle eastern food and desert  i love the pastries  try a turkish coffee,4
food was fresh and authentic but way overpriced owner was nice and so was girl behind counter will i be back maybe but only ordering food once you add in 2 drinks and 3 desserts the bill begins to rack up,2
amena had really good service and have really good platesthey have great prices i recommend it,4

the sushi here is good go during happy hour because the prices are great the service was really fantastic the staff were friendly helpful and polite my first experience here was a really good one ill be back whenever im back in town,3
it is the place i go for burgers  fatburgers  the shakes and fries simply tidy the meal up in my opinion,4
love their chicken pot pie soup  i had to get a bowl of it  and then a poboy pastrami melt  yum,3
love this place employees are so friendly place is clean food is good love the pasta salad,3
anything free is alright with me especially in vegas this show is alright although the volcano flames get so hot you can feel it,2
it was an ok show dont be too dissapointed if you miss it,2
its freenits got a good amount of firenits freenits got some cool lighting affectsnits freenits got some cool sound effectsnits free nits kinda short and may not be the best show in vegas but nits free so im a fan,2
for airport mexican food i will give it a little credit  my suggestion is keep it simple order something like a quesadilla where odds of failure are really low and youll probably come out alright,2
great service amazing staff they know their stuffwhatever it is they have everything i need and even stuff i didnt know i needed,4
the bacon and eggs were great and the coffee was also the sandwiches not my favorite but breakfast is a yes,2
re was delicious tapas sadly they are now closed,2
their emu oil is great  i use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders its wonderful  i highly recommend it  we buy it at fresh vitamins in mesa  no dyes fully refined i love it,4
awesome  pizza rocks  pasta is great homemade stuff  really different than pretty much italian type restaurants,4
drivers are crooks they write in their own tips managers arent very helpful either all crooks order somewhere else not here,0
for a good quick lunch you can taste excellent burgers and meat also done in different ways i want to emphasize the excellent quality of the meat priced accordingly about 10 u20ac to personaenrico,3
omg i loved it i had the las vegas dog my gf had the mob boss dogg and we smashed its a nice cozy spot perfect for watching a game eating great food and grabbing a beer 3 thumbs up if i had another lol,3
to this day i will never understand the hype its fast food junk,1
awful did i say awful this place is a real lv stinker over hype overpriced over full of itself whatever you do dont order fish i thought the place in beverly hills was over the top  with a view of the driveway and unloading vans and limos really a mess in progress,0
amazing dinner outstanding service  nnprime filet mignon carpaccio celery hearts truffle hollandaise white truffles from alba italy usda prime illinois corn fed aged 21 days bone in new york sirloin 20 oz rare wild field mushrooms  japanese shishito peppers a meal to remember,4

read the reviews and ordered the porterhouse for two with a side of bone marrowwowwas the marrow richi think we drank an extra bottle of wine because of thatnnthe porterhouse rarewas perfectcold center and melt in your mouth tendernnthe wild mushrooms sides was delicious,3
horrible dont waist your money i left before they could even finish my order go to a different chipotle,0
fatty steak in the steak tacos toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound 12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos me thinks not,1
slow service and small portions  food is good but not worth the wait,2
its innout burger you cant go wrong,3
really people its in n out burger do i really have to say anymore except fresh and yummy,4
most locations are usually the same but this branchs lettuce tends to always be soggy and the bread either over cooked or old,2
just came in for a smog check its 1995 regular price but with the coupon mailer its 1495 cant really complain much about it simple service in and out and cheaper than jiffy smog definitely,2
therapy is a good little place to go i didnt try the food but the drinks were good and not too expensivennthings were creative and we had a fantastic bartender who found a few drinks for someone as picky as i am to fully enjoynntry their irish coffees simply fantstic,3
an az original 2hippies the best people the best price the best burgers,4
got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good everything on the menu sounds great the employees were super nice cant wait to come back,4
the service was outstanding  the waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience  the food was good but i have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 12 the price,2
overpriced food wasnt very good the service was only decent if you go to cadillac ranch go for the eye candy and the bar on a friday or saturday night otherwise you will walk out feeling like you just kissed your sister yeah i said it,1
not a fan i visited here 4 times over a year ago thought the food was mediocre at best the atmosphere was cool and the service ok not interested in returning have lots of other options the atmosphere is unique and cool but not enough to return,1
i come here often for lunch and dinner and love all the vegan options the crazy pita salad and mediterranean salad are both great and their hummus with whole wheat pita is delish crazy pita is great,4
good food,4
the cookies at cookiez are so thin and yummy i dont think you can go wrong with any flavor of ice cream or type of cookie  but i havent tried anything too crazynthe workers here are also very friendly and give great customer service,3
this place is heavenly i have dreams about it on a regular basis the cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors tasty,4
very good sushi prices are a bit high but im not complaining  ill be back,3
great service every time food is excellent levi is the best servergreat place for a few glasses of wine fun atmosphere  delicious food the ice cream is amazing,3
i love their pizzasnand now they have pastas and theyre awesome toonni still prefer postinos bruschetta but i cant seem to put my finger on why  i think it might be the bread,3
best place to eat on mill if youre looking for italian and something casual the pizza and bruschetta is what they are known for,3
carne asada meat was dog food qualitysimultaneously fatty and tough  the woman who took my order had trouble communicating in english  and they have a no substitutions policy so youre stuck paying 2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo,0
great food but awful service,2
really great panang this is one of the best place to eat lunch in the area,4
good place to go and eat gyros if your up in north scottsdale the staff is friendly and the food gets to you real fast the price is somewhere between 710 per meal but thats usual for n scottsdale,2
just tried this place for the first time the gyro was the best ive had i never thought anyone could beat my greek gyro place in scottsdale but these guys have done just that definitely recommend eating here,4
the pizza is pretty good and the prices are decent ive ordered from them several times however the pizza never seems to be cooked fully through its always thin and doughy in the middle,2
ive ordered their pizza based on yelpers review meh i didnt want it after a bite,1
good wings even better screwdriver plenty of tvs nice  location kinda of on the expensive side its a  cardinals bar  but they show every  game thats on during sunday,3

stacys smokehouse came recomended and it lived up to thier words  nicole at the front was friendly and helpful with making the correct choicesgo big because youll come back for more if you dont  the onion rings and bbq pork sandwich were delicous and ill be looking to come back again soon,3
not bad but no great shakes  the large pulled pork sandwich was hefty but kinda bland  lots of sauce helped  sweet potato fries were underdone and way too cinnamonsugared  service was indifferent  you can get better barbecue in plenty of places in phoenix,1
this location is awful they changed names and nothing actually changed besides that food isnt very good dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions so many better places to choose from wont be going back,0
the pho was delicious the place was cute and the prices were decent also the service was amazing the waiter offered to warm up my sons bottle good service goes a long way so we will definitely be back,3
this place is crazy dirty  the ribs are tough the pulled pork okay  ate here because we had a social media coupon  will not go back i wrote another review of this place at one star but it has gone missing,1
this is something i will definitely pass on next time around  i do not know whether it was the 109 degree temperature or the throngs of people but it made it is something that not worth wasting your time on,0
would you like some wine with this cheeeeze  i suppose the kiddos would love watching a free pseudo pirate show but why would you bring kids to sin city to begin withnnits so kitschy and vegas strip cliche you have to check it out just for pure noveltys sake,1
girls in lingerie explosions pirates oneliners and more girls in lingerie  whats not to lovennits a great show to experience at least once  its pretty cheesy but hey youre in las vegas  no problem bringing the kidsthey will be amazed by the songs dancing and pyrotechnics,2

as always awesome a great innout location perfect food for a great price its busy as you might think an innout might be in vegas really busy did i say it was busy but its worth the ten minute wait inside i think drive through might be faster it depends,4

wow  great tasting every time  love everything i have ever tried  highly recommend,4
best tacos i have had in vegas the number 8 10 and 11 all yummy  mind you not traditional necessarily more fusion in nature so good and cheap,4
the staff is always nice and cheerful although they can be a bit ignorant ive received beer poured into the wrong kind of glass and they nearly always mispronounce quinoa but the vegan tacos are yummy and the laid back atmosphere is relaxing and fun,3
we are in vegas on vacation and we always enjoy finding the local places to eat that you just cant find anywhere else yayo taco was excellent im pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu the pollo the camarones the texano and the shanghi tacos were incredible you gotta go,4
great for a lunch salad with girlfriends  if youre not into rabbit food the pasta lunch specials are tasty too but be prepared to nap the rest of your workday,2
ive been 4 times now  i continue to have a meh opinion  food is ok  certainly overpriced  comparable in quality to other chain italian joints but higher in pricennthe service is always great and the happy hour is really nice  worth a visit but dont expect great food,1

loved this place it was my first time going with some friends great beers on tap and you can try a new one every time you go go after work with some friends and enjoy happy hour,3
really good food and one of if not the best selection of beer between here and the next closest yard house  the happy hour prices are even better,3
food was ok great place for hang  out or for watching sports great selection beers,2
the music is a little too loud but their food is so good their burger with the lobster and asparagus is my favorite meal on the menu love it,4
great place i love their veggie burger,3
over rated better food else where waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son my turkey club sandwich  dry although i did enjoy the small side of cesar salad hence the 2 stars,1
the draft beer selection makes this place far above what the food does the food is good but normal nothing bad but nothing amazing besides the beer loved it and im not even a beer fanaticndave,3
i used to like sundance when it just opened but it has really gone downhill nnthe service is awful and the food is just as bad,0

busy airport eatery  nuff said,1
best sushi in az great for a group of friends 20 all you can eat,4
so i usually have a good experience here the chefs are very nice as they were today but if youre not at the sushi bar the service is much slower when it comes to the sushi overall not bad but could have been much better service,3
we went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food just a truly ridiculous amount of time i felt like the sushi was below average as well wouldnt come back,1
the theatres are too small they overcharge on refreshmentssnacks customer service really isnt all that great,0
i like this place every time i come theres a small line even on opening night and the screens arent bad they give student discount except on the weekends they always give military discounts so thats another reason why i like coming here oh you also get free refills on popcorn too so eat up,2
wackness defined twenty bucks for food that makes tgifridays look like it deserves a michelin star even for an airport this place is overpriced and not worth a stop the service was decent but that was the only redeeming quality whatsoever about this place avoid,0
waiting for the connection flight i decided to get a beer i found the home turf bar which was right next to my gatenni wasnt hungry and just wanted a quick beer before my flight they had shocktop which is okay with me it was an okay place to pass the time before it was time to move on,2
was good had more than one pool only downfall is that all of them only went up to 3 12 feet,3
what can i say i love lazy rivers even though  there is probably a huge percentage of alcohol and pee its still fun its like adults on a hamster wheel drunk if you get sick of the hamster wheel try the nachos they are huge and the yummiest pool side snack they offer,4
average food at best wings undercooked and greasy onion rings underwhelming service poor waited 30 minutes when place wasnt busy  wont be back,1
not impressed the staff was standing around the pizza by the slice was limited to two choices that looks to have been sitting for a while and wasnt very good  and no one seemed to really care,1
shortline for a quick bite nothing special,2
food was standard chinese fare the wonton soup is very good and worth the upgradennwhen i went they seemed short staffed and overwhelmed had a long wait between wait staff visits place needed cleaning from an apparent lunch rush,2
its fast its friendly and about as inexpensive as you can get in desert ridge  wasnt blown away by thier food but i would go back,2
happy halloween costco members  come see us soon the fuel price this week is 2759,4

been here a couple times on weekend evenings and it is pretty busy the service is a bit slow but not horrible the food is good not amazing but i should note that im not the biggest seafood personnnprosn5 sake bombers all daynsit at the bar get free miso soup,2
dont waste stomach space on maria2 in an area this full of tasty restaurants sugary margaritas sloppily presented meals stale chipsnnyou can do better,1

overpriced nno service nthis place used to be good every time we go vegas wed go this place but this time i was really disappointed lack of service  overpriced items not worth the hypenwell look different place for our sushi spot next visit,0
great service and environment brazilian  sushi cant go wrong order 34 items and share,4
little expensive for what you get  food was really good but i found myself spending quite more than i expected too for lunchnnas a plus side they claim the krab is crab in a california roll nnfood was tasty just a bit higher priced than i would like,3
food is great  high end sushi  josh the mgr hooked us up with a few apps on the house  bad part  our server was terrible christy or something like that  she needs to go work at dennys with an attitude like that  wont be going back,1
the fixed price dinners are well worth the price  the service here is just as great as the food  ive had dinner here on two separate vegas trips and will definitely be back,4
cost 500 every time came here to have yummy sashimi but the last time really sucks one oyster stink n wholly smell was of my favorite but wont go there again,2
do not sit at the bar the bartender was a total jerk and made it very clear that he didnt want to help us the sad thing is that the food was good and when we relocated to the back of the restaurant or experience improved and our waiter was much nicer and helpful,1
service a  staff was very accommodating and great  food was overpriced and terrible 1 star for great service but would have rather had crappy service and great food,0
insanely expensive average like any good sushi bar and the palazzo in my opinion is pretty plain nnif its sushi you seek the osaka sushi restaurant on sahara will blow you away nntheres a lot better places than this one pass,2
if i could give this place 0 stars i would that is how bad the food was it seemed like they had only cooked 10 dishes and sadly the most memorable dish was the frozen corn i didnt think it was humanly possible but i have finally found a buffet worse than hometown buffet good job circus circus,0
we paid 1399 per person and there was two aisles of the same exact food small amount of choices not the best quality not worth my money save your time and money find another buffet but this one,0
my husband son daughter and i went for a sunday lunch my little girl who is only 2 did not want to sit still and cried so we left so other people could actually enjoy their lunch husband went back to pick up our lunch so we could enjoy it at home we were very pleased we will be back,3
this is an average food spot with really good service im not really big on all the wok stuff so i had to find some alternativesand there really arent many we had a good time and our service was funny id go back,2
all the food was excellent especially the sliders our waitress was excellent we have been here many times and are never disappointed,3
calamari is very good did not like pot stickers at all and normally this is one of our favorite dishes chicken rice soup is absolutely delish  great happy hour menu too,3
ive tried this place 3 times now and well it just doesnt live up to its hype   it is trendy clean decorated nicely located strategically and the service is good   but for me the food is just eh ok the special martinis are just eh ok and its pricey,1
60 for 4 rolls that we werent that impressed with i find that pricey,1
it was okay overpriced for average quality food dont think i nwould ever go againnnthe wasabi was blue,1
ive had sushi from all over and blue wasabi is my favorite spot wish i had one close to where i live now any of the rolls are great and service is always top notch nnsmall recommendation  sit outside the lighting is a bit dark inside,4
its a must do oncetighten your pants bring a second pair for the oppps when doing there ridescheck photos out buffet is good and i win there in the casino 3 card slots,3
i purchased unlimited and i shouldve brought the one use pass the rides were ok great view however the rides wasnt scary im and adrenaline junky and i love roller coasters but these rides didnt do it for me,1
i just purchased a glazed and chocolate covered donut here both were very stale and must have been sitting on the shelf for a  very long time i took one bite from each then threw them into the trash where they belong you would think dunkin donuts would keep fresh goods on their shelves,0
this place runs out of certain donuts at a certain time i was told it takes 3 hours to make chocolate munchkins,1
overpriced unfriendly staff manager outside smoking constantly very poorly managed store if you look in the grocery section youll see items out of code that shouldnt be on the shelfnpoor customer service and not staffed properly used to be better but ajs has gone downhill fast,0
the lady at the window was short  rude 36 donuts were incorrect she had already walked away  would not come back after handing me my latte which was mostly foam what a way to start your morning,0
best jewish deli and bakery in town awesome staff amazing food and out of control baked goods we try to go to chompies at least once a weekend for breakfast my favorite is the all american with a poinsettia champaign and cranberry to drink,4
horrible dont give a crp service the worst i have experienced in any restaurant here in the valley the manager gary is an apathetic weasel with no customer service skills anyone want to buy a 25 gift card from this dump,0
the best foodnpastrami you need two people to eat itntheir breakfast is amazing especially the chicago scramblentheir cream cheeses are homemadentheir bakery is amazingnthey give military discounts every daynthe owner lovey is wonderful,4
i had the mackerel and spicy tuna with a couple of beers and it chimed in for 100 not a good experience from a service standpoint either the sushi was mediocre at best nndont waste your,1
overcrowded overrated overpriced tourist place in the bellagio horrible i mean horrible service,1
they have some very tasty unique dishes here that are worth coming back  the tuna sushi pizza is to die for  i have eaten here four times and get it every time  the yellowtail blood orange carpaccio is also very tasty  lastly the king crab tempura with ponzu is also divine,3
we came here for m bachelorette party and all 15 of us girls thought it was the best restaurant and fish we had ever eaten i highly recommend this place order the spicy tuna pizza enjoy,4
definitely my favorite it is so easy to come and go there is never a real mess either i like that their remodel is so handy for check outs renewals and returnsnnawesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request,4
forget panda expressnnbeef rollnpeanut sesame noodlenfish  tofu soup my favorite nduck  nice mild flavornkung pao chicken  standard but delicious,3
i really would not consider myself a fan of this type of music but dang i was loving every minute of this production  i still dont really like the genre but would go back in an instant  fantastic job and a fun storyline keeps it rolling right to a really great ending,4
i feel like everytime i have come in service and quality have gone way down im going to sauce from now on for sure,2
it was disaster bread was hard and burnt one dish was served and three others waited more than five minutes for their meal manager gave a free desert for the service we thought that was anice gesture until we got our check al items were marked up 800can you believe it could be this bad,0
hahahaah777 all day where can you find else in the statesnthey served chinese food italian food american food etc theres nothing special but with that price what can you blame aboutnnps the bread pudding there is so goodlol,1
fried okra was fresh hot and delicious pulled pork beef and chicken were all served cold so was sauce  beans wont return,0
pros pulled pork barbeque sauce wood chips service dave was great paper table covers sauteed veggies sweet potato friesnncons all were only minorly disappointing watery lemonade dry cornbread no baked beans sandwich buns mac and cheese okay nnoverall would recommend not quite as good as billed,2
i asked for a grilled tuna rare and it came to me well done along with soggy asparagus  the rest of the table did not have any issues with their meals,1
solid 25 star airport restaurant generally ths place is dirty and the food is marginal however the c terminal offers very little in terms of real foodni was very happy with the servicejust wish theyd do a serious remodel on the 80s sportsbar motif,1
ordered nachostook about 20 mins for it to come out sour cream looked like cottage cheese and they use the shredded microwaveable cheese nnthe beer is good cant really go wrong with that,1
customer service is always and i mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but i continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up,0
dry n small tamales i had high hopes because it seemed legit keep looking if you wsnt really good tamales,1
queen creek olive mill has delicious sandwiches gelato and of course olive and balsamic vinegar products i wouldnt come here for breakfast because its pretty standard fare but the sandwiches are great its a little bit pricey but its a nice experience,3
went for the garlic festival  love this place but where was the garlic festival  they were selling some garlic but that was it  very disappointing i will continue to buy their oils and spreads but wont bother to attend anymore festivals,1
not only is the food delicious but the service was fantastic as well the staff did everything to make sure me and my kids had a great experience ill be back again soon,4
worst customer service i have ever recieved in my entire life i know that sounds dramatic and harsh but it really was terrible we got stuck in there over 3 hours our server was rude food was mediocre,0
horrible customer service i understand the workers are helping customers out but none greeted or asked if i needed help i stood there for a good twenty minutes before leaving  i am an iphone user but this makes me want to leave the brand i had some questions that websites dont have a clear answer to,0
normally im impressed with apple store customer service this location sucks every interaction i have with the staff here is rude the girl helping me with an exchange was asking me how to do it good thing i was there to help 2 stars only because they are efficient thats all,1
came here in the afternoon got super lucky and got 2 front row seats  in front of the wave pool   drinks are duh expensive   15 each nnloved the sun and sand  nn1 star for having to pay for the tubes  25  for the lazy river,3
favorite park in the city beautiful spot fitnessfamily or fun,4
where is 2470 w happy valley rd  its not near the large 2480 number on the building in the middle of the block on the north side of the street,0
we started off with the usual chips and salsas followed by 2item combinations  enchilada and chile relleno served with refried beans unadorned salad and spanish rice  though restaurant names differ the same mediocre texmex food may be found in most casinos,0
intimate restaurant seats about 70 neat but a bit over priced steaks were not great and 70 person for 2 sodas 1 bottle of average wine with the meal and no desserts we wouldnt go back,1
just an average bagel place,1
one of the best vietnamese restaurants in phoenix this place is acids the street fro leileis and hidden from view dont miss it try the chicken wings and especially the grapes leaves the staff are very nice the ambiance is wanting and music dated but this is a must,3
had a large pho tai with raw beef absolutely delicious best pho ive had in the phx area,4
oohhni really wish they hadnt adopted our cities shorthand for their lame clubs nameni actually waited in line w my brother to get inside this dumpnughhnit waswellsurrealnseemed like a bad dreamnhopefully that bad dream will never repeat itself,1
very delicious and fresh food i love the various menu items and what they have to offer we came here for dinner with a friend from out of town and everyone at our table was more than satisfied i love how this place supports local produce and farms yum,3
if you want a great gourmet cupcake go to the cake artists studio on bloomington road they are cheaper and shes an accomplished pastry chef the cupcakes at cakes are overpriced and not special at all,1
way too yummy get the red velvet,4
i hate to say this but out of all of the cupcakeries ive tried cream  flutter is my least favorite  from frosting to cakevery disappointing  maybe i should go for a cookie next time,1
very slow service and they werent very busy decent food very loud inside  nice patio when it isnt hot,2
what a wonderful evening the ono was amazing and our server recommended a wine that went perfectly with it service was great we will be back,4
we stopped here for a friday night date night it was our first visit and well definitely return the food the service affordability and ambience are all excellent on our keeper list for sure,4
beautiful lights for christmas  great to come and see with or without kids  always try to do some of the local stuff when we go places so while this was off the strip by a lot it was worth the time,4
i will eat here when a friend insists but i think almost every time ive eaten here i have gotten diarrhea  and the food isnt worth the diarrhea  its kind of bland  and its overpriced  just my opinion though  i know lots of people are gaga over this place,1
i went once and wasnt impressed  i tried it again and it didnt fare any better,0
i went looking for frozen bags of edamame and sweet rice coconut milk and ripe mango to make a sticky rice dessert i found everything at super l ranch market ill be back,3
first time eating here last night started off with the hummus for an appetizer and got the gyro for my main meal everything was excellent,3
i was drove past there this weekend and then read yesterday on azcentralcom that they have closed their doors  i had never dined there but the building  decor looks awesome huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace guess its just another sign of the struggling economy,2
i admit my spouse is a bigger fan but the food is fresh and authentic in style we go often as the lighter fare is a nice break from traditional american cuisinennthey regularly have coupons in the val packs which arrive in the mail monthly making a full meal out hard to resist,3
amazing food friendly staff affordable prices you must check it out,4
waited for an hour during lunch they took my order waited forever and ended up having to leave without eating because i needed to get back to work,0
just about the only place left on mill that you can go to dance good drinks and actually pretty laid back for a club,3
friendly and courteous staff the quality of the toppings are always properly maintained and fresh,3
wow first time in a while and this place is a mess kinda disgustingkid was too busy counting the tipsnnpreviously there used to be a girl who i would always see working here that kept the spot super cleanall i can say is if i were the health department they wouldnt get an a grade today,1
ok more of a 35 star sushi joint nothing i had was mindblowing,2
not the best not horrible waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is pretty lame this place is very overrated,1
the boneless wings though tasty were all batter i picked most of it off the burger looks amazing and was huge could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good,2
your basic mexican grill place with burritos enchiladas etc  a bit overpriced due to its location  food was good not excellent but the hours are great so you can get decent mexican food fairly latennthere werent very many people when i went but service was very slow,2
good food nice service decent price for the strip way less busy than other nearby similar mexican restaurants probably because its indoors only but good break from the heat great 10 lunch special 15 with a margarita,3
worst enchiladas ever and decor from a 1980s attempt at a mexican restaurant  taco bell is a step up  but if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you,0
seated and forgotten on a saturday night servers looking bored how about check you table jeez,0
sat for 15minutes no one came to serve us they checked on the booth in front of us but ignored us completely going to cracker barrel down the road,0
my absolute favorite place to go in pittsburgh during the summer months it gets pretty crowded but in the winter just grab a hot chocolate then head up there at night and its beautiful so peaceful,4
this place used to be fun now all you get us over priced drinks that are watered down and poor service i definitely wont be back,0
the food was not only beautifully presented but delicious the sommelier was very approachable and helped us narrow our wine selection perfectly a thoroughly enjoyable experience,4
best grilled chicken in charlotte pio pio,4
they close at 10pm   we got there at 915 and the host refuses to seat and serve us  will never go back there and give them anymore business,0
i actually cant give a thorough review of this place since all i had were french fries and a milkshake which were both good all 3 of my friends who ordered burgers were violently ill the next day not me though needless to say we havent been back since,0
the burgers are good but not amazing the chili dogs arent bad either but for me the only reason i keep coming back to this place is to keep trying more of the milk shake flavors that they have  so far blueberry is my favorite but ive only tried about six so far,2
i actually love everything about this place except one critical problem the buns are probably the worst buns i know of anywhere they are horrible and they fall apart i took the time to write the company no response i can walk there love everything else but cant go for a burger sad,2
this place blows  food had no taste and shake was below average for a higher than deserved price  johnny rockets blows this place away and i even prefer a dennys burger and shake for half the price,0
love this place  it is a blessing and very reasonably priced,4
a darn good panini nice neighborhood cafelots of kids playingbright colored decorgood food the tables rock sometimesand the tables can be a little stickybuta darn good panini,2
corn breadgood  street tacosvery good  the baked seafood enchiladanot so good tasted very fishy  tortilla soupnot so good but maybe be average for a texmex style,2
wowas bad as it gets and ive been traveling for 39 years terrible terrible terrible,0
i got the car and rates i expected and they were cheaper than the rest  but so did the 20 people standing in line ahead of me i imagine  absolutely no other rental place had a line and payless had a huge one  i would have spent the extra 2 a day to avoid the big wait when i got there,1
very good chinese food i had since i moved out here i love their big portions and that they deliver all the time and on time i love the shrimp with lobster sauce shrimp walnut and there egg soup the family sets are good,3
this place is by far the best chinese take out place that i gave eaten in i lived in ny and been to california several times and this place is just as good or better you get a lot if food for little money they are quick with their deliveries or pick up order as well keep up the good job guys,4
tried it for the first time over the weekend ordered 2 lunch specials  the portions were awesome the food tasted decent but i felt that the sauces were a little too sweet in flavor ill order different dishes next time,3
flavors and portions were spot on but customer service is lacking while the service leaves much to be desired it wouldnt prevent me from frequenting the restaurant,3
the tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they cant be bothered to deal with you but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when im having cravings,2
i enjoyed my experience very much  if i lived closer i would be there often  great happy hour  should consider opening a seperate location in summerlin that does tapas  i would be there,3
id never eaten sushi before and this conveyer belt style was a great way to get introduced i got to see everything available and ask questions about everything in real time rather than be force to decide from a menu my more experianced sushi friends raved about it to,3
horrible horrible horrible service we sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye,0
the food is decent but with the handful of times ive been thereworst customer service ever,0
great food again an great service love the thai teahas become a fav place,3
i come here about once a year and then i remember why i dont come here more often my car was next in line to get washed and 3 corp vans were moved in front of me and now i wait will prob take 40 mins to get out of here,0
we ate here last weekend not a long wait all you can drink coffee pot and great food in love with the healthy one the crepe eggs are so good  we will be coming back took away one star because we had to wait awhile to flag down our waiter to get the check,3
my favorite boutique on mill ave  the prices are very reasonable wtih a huge sale section  i can always find something that i love and cant live without  the store is clean and easy to navigate  very friendly and helpful staff as well,4
dinner was poor service bad food and too expensive  good location for happy hour only,0
the front desk staff was very pleasant hotel is old the kitchen appliances is very old we booked four rooms four nights each one w old appliances housekeeping didnt refurnish daily supply wouldnt stay here ever again,0
horrible service plus very expensive food restaurant was empty and it took a half an hour for a waiter to come and take our order for drinks would not recommend,0
loved it  perfect thin and charred crust and great toppings  very fast service for a busy place  better than the place at hilldale,4
great atmosphere n great food non the pricey side,3
two words  shitty service,1
had my gf office party here it was meh probably wont go here again but i can see the appeal to some folks,2
friendly hostess who also brought our food i think the food was okay for the price we paid but the coffee was excellent nice and strong unlike american coffee probably will give it another try soon,2
food is better than servicecashier acts as if shes doing me a favoreven though she was nicely rudethis is sad because goodyear could use more good mom  pop businesses,1
just watched the chef drop his tongs on the ground pick them up and use them again refund yes please  not returning to this place when i asked him about it he wouldnt respond to me,0
oh my chocolishisness nnthese are ridiculously flavorful no guessing youll know which is which and uniquely textured i would certainly not wait for valentines day it deserves all five stars while definitely a luxury totally worth it for chocolate lovers or for any level of chocolate appreciaters,4
the toasted panini that i had cold meat in the center the music inside was obnoxiously loud the only reason that im giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice everything else was less than savory,1
good spot for brunch but over priced,2
food is alright had the mac and cheese and country green beans the biscuits were good sis was insistent on trying it and since we were crunched on time we took it togo took a while for the take out and prices are pretty high for the quality,2
i was surprised to find that had a ton of brand new irrigation supplies as a gardener i am always fiddling with the irrigation and am in constant need of emitters hose and connectors to support my filthy habit they have it all at least when i went and at a fraction of what the hardware store charges,2
surprised but it actually was good  yes pizza hut and good at least at 1030am this is the place to be,3
i love this location it is extremely easy to get to and i often find myself here to check out their new styles the prices are very reasonable and the staff is helpful,3
im not a real big shopper at dsw but i did find some super awesome boots i saw on pinterest for 100 they also give out military discounts they have a great selection to choose from,2
what kind of a burger king does not serve chicken sandwich this is like the only burger kind ive been so far that only serves one type of chicken sandwich in two stylecrispy or grillwhatever happen to the fish or the orignal chicken sandwich what a disappointment,0
the food is nothing spectacular the only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday,1
went here with the husband and our 2 teens and we all get something different so we could share everyone enjoyed their smoothie and the employees here were very friendly nni just wish these dang things were a little less priceyand i would eat em more often they are like having a meal,3
tylor and glenn were the best i was the one that got there one minute to closing and they stayed open for me awesome service,4
great staff but dry cigars wasted 20 on two cigars that are as hard as a rockvery frustrating when you want to end the night with a good stogie,0
nice shop with experienced barbers one visit so far but an excellent cut with an excellent taper in the back nstraight razor neck shave with cream and oster massage at the endnhighly recommend darwin the barber,4
complaint not properly addressedni had a full leg wax and got burned the technique was immature and when i called the salon to complain they offered me products to buy thats ridiculous way of doing business i went to the scottsdale location and will never be going back stay away from that place,0
45 before tip for a mens haircut supercuts coulda done i wont go back,1
this gyms okay lots of machines friendly staff parking isnt a big issue but it tends to get packed most likely because its the new year you cant go wrong with there pricing i guess if your gonna work out go really early in the morning or late at night,2
scale of 110 multiple visitsn7 foodn8 servicen8 atmospheren7 value,2
the costco of italian restaurantsnnterrible food and servicennlisten i get italian family style dining in fact i am a fan of it especially being from ny but what you serve i wouldnt feed my dognnplease leave nnthank you and good day,0
allot of good food cheesy garlic bread was bomb very addictive pretty busy night due to prom our waitress was very good we have to make it back for the lasagne overall a good experience,3
dissappointedni used to cherish my visits at this restaurant i craved the potato soupnnow that they have switched owners they have made many changes for the worse the soup was curdled lacked flavor and potatoes the pot pie was extremely dry ni will stick to the other places at town square,1
seriously  you really dont want me to spend my money here ok  the most od aweful service i have ever received in a retail store in my life   they literally turned a few hundred dollars worth of sales i was about to make out the door  i will never go back here again,0
huge store if you know forever 21and like try hair styles youll love this storethough theres never anyone around when you cant reach something,3

good food but the service was slow,2
friendly staff good atmosphere  inside or outside seating option is goodnnsmall portions sizes high price compared to most pizza establishments  taste is averagennthey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer,1
we like to go here for tapas happy hour  fun little plates of deliciousness that are great for sharingnnits a good family place and our picky eater can always order pizza theres a kids menu  nnservice is usually pretty good,3
i go to starbucks all over and this one is super slow and super rude this is def the worst starbucks in town avoid it like the plague,0
always a different experience i guess it just depends on whose working thank goodness for drive through starbucks,3
this is the only starbucks in my neighborhood so i go here by default friendly enough staff but they are consistently sooooo slow,1
service timing and most importantly the food was great  i ordered the filet and it was cooked perfectly the way i like it  the asparagus and potatoes au grautin were awesome  a must if you dine out regularly,4
steak was good a little on the salty side but did the job i would go back but would look at other options first,2
clean very tasty and i love the creativity in the dishes  well worth the price and i recommend trying different dishes because with each new dish i try i have not been disappointed,4
amazing food awesome owner just great everything love this place and definitely plan on going back,4
very small place about 9 or 10 tables and few seats at the bar if you want to dine during dinner time you better make reservations weeks in advance very high quality japanese food definitely not cheap one of the best meal i have ever had foe gras was to die for 2 thumbs way way up,4
we didnt have reservations so we didnt get to try the food but the guy in front was so rude so i dont think well be back,0
omikase was not worth the price service wasnt great the server told us no sharing which was a big turnoff would not recommend,1
great sandwiches the bread was superb i had a bltda bacon lett tomato date apple wchicken yummm such a cute spot,3
5 for a drink and original pollo bowl rice beans chicken not a bad deal for a fast food place it reminds me of a cheaper chipotle definitely get the avocado salsa,2
the mrs and i shared a turkey and pesto and we liked it better than the other stuff around we got lucky as a group of people came in after us and still werent served as we were leaving,2
i have curly hair so i am always cautious about where i get my hair cut alice at the willy st location is awesome she has given me great cuts and shes fun to chat with i had let about 5 months go by in between my haircuts and she remembered me i was impressed,4
just hope youre there on a good day buffets are not what they used to be in vegas,2
this business is closed,0
parking is a nightmare and the vendors produce looks half dead every time ive been there isnt anything here you cant get in better shape at the grocery store,1
put a menu onlinennfb page doesnt work  hurting takeout business,1
clean and cute   oh yeah and good food  service is pretty good a little slow when they get busy which is a lot because its not very big  they have wooden menus,3
our favorite thai place in the valley it is small so be prepared to wait on the weekend yellow curry pepper steak and pad thai is the best,4
i didnt find this place to be anything special  service was average ambiance was average  all of us ordered the house special vogue steak and they were tough as shoe leather definitely below average  for the price which was fairly steep i bet you could do better,1
muddy sound unimpressive seatsmeh  it seemed pretty worn down for being such a new theater  ill stick to one of the two big chains,1
update holy crap  went back and ordered two scoops of ice cream instead was given worlds biggest blob of ice cream in a huge cup which is good or bad depending,2
i love the pink spot  nit is so cute inside and smells soooooo good the staff is always nice the ice cream is to die for where else can you get a home made ice cream taco or cookie sandwich chocolate covered bannana and bond bonds last night i had my first european sunday yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,4
the best ice cream sandwich in town and for future reference they deliver whats not to likennplenty of adventurous flavors if youre into that sort of thing and if you want the usual suspects im a mint chip aficionado youll be pleased im going to be back a lot,4
the location is perfect its in downtown phoenix and connected to z pizza they offer a variety of items to choose from breakfast food ice cream baked delicacies etcnnthe downside is that its dark in there it feels kind of depressing there is not very much parking,2
very yummy its really fun to try all the different flavors here and its a cool place to take friends or out of town guests everything is so unique and its so cool that all the items are made in the store the staff is also friendly and knowledgeablennjust thinking about this place is making me hungry,3
amazing ice cream  what i appreciate the most is the natural high quality ingredientsmeyer lemon is insane and the owner helen is so helpful what an amazing small local business,4
i love the mint chocolate chip real mint leaves instead of imitation flavoring the peppermint is fabulous also really you cant go wrong,4
since my last review ive eliminated dairy from my dietboo hoo but no worries they have at least 4 vegan options all the time coconut sorbet and chocolate sorbet are amazing,4
best in vegas bar none  thanks mr wynn for repeated great stays and memories  well keep coming back,4
great hotel but be cautious of the hidden fees they will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there,1
every meal i have here is good  i love the pancakes and breakfast burrito  the staff is very nice and helpful love donna jo the service is great and the price is right,4
great environment great bartenders just an ok placeto dine id go to 4 stars if i were reviewing a good time but as such 3 stars have it i would have to say the best food is their fish tacos but i havent tried everything on the menu so give it a shot,2
great coffee but dont go here if youre in a hurry they employ only college students who are over the top friendly but who also think keeping people waiting in line for 15 minutes while they talk to their friends is totally cool,0
so apparently the food was horrible according to 4 people so i know i wont be back for food even though the gravy cheese curd fries looked yummy enough,0
my favorite starbucks location  staff aways polite and friendly  clean with lots of space  its very convenient and easy to get in and out of parking lot  drive through gets me in and out in a hurry,3
never had a bad drink from this store the drive thru can get a little long but its worth the wait,4
great atmosphere good food and good service if you are in the belmont area a must stop i had a burger which was great in this little hometown irish pub,3
great place will be back jock welcomed us had good conversation and answered questions i had no problem will be back,4
i tried going here earlier today with my mom and sister and it turns out that its closed  we read the notice posted at the window that said that it was temporarily closed for remodeling  i sent a message to a moderator about the closure so hopefully itll be updated soon,0
the tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy  i probably could have told this just by looking but i had gotten lost on my way to gingers and was hungrynnat least it was cheap,1
the food was ok but tricky advertisingnthe sign out side says in small letters salmon and then 50 off sushi in big letters  you think everything is 50 off its only order of salmon sushi  vary tricky advertising  so we wont go back,1
good food with very reasonable prices,4
love their tacos service is fast and friendly place is cleanbathrooms clean need to be better at keeping the guacamole made so people dont have to wait,3
good ribs amazing hot links and service with a smile,3
besides the racist joke about all single mothers are black my nipple piercing went fairly quickly they hurt like hell but i like it,2
amazinghyper clean friendly and very nice overall  plenty of relaxation and naked bodies for all  if you have a naked phobia this might not be the place for you or stay upstairs im a regular especially in the dry salt room,4
this is my first korean spa experience and i loved it my favorites are the red clay ball room the red clay dome room and the ice room this is a great experience if you just want to go somewhere away from the strip and relax i will definitely visit again the next time i am in vegas highly recommend,4
im in love wow omg this is my honey comb hideaway their are lots of places nearby to eat also its off the beaten path so its my definition of in the cuts,4
horrible customer service i will not return if i could give this place zero stars i would,0
my wife and i come here frequently and always get the vegetable curry keep up the good work,4
yuk  no casino  no view  small open shared pool nnwhy would you want to go to las vegas and stay at a hotel like this  nnluckily the staff was nice enough to not charge us for bailing,0
saggy beds piss me off,1
slow and lazy people took 3 hours with appointment to change the tires wheels were not torqued to correct specs thanks god and i didnt get into accident,0
the chaat was soupy but tasted right keema matar just wasnt ive tried them twice now and both times there was something off about the sauces spicing is heavy and not consistent with the way ive had the same dishes before for what its worth i had no issues with my delivery,1
i truly enjoyed my experience at tandoor the staff was super friendly the flavors were both fresh and savory you must order the samosas and  garlic naan to start my curry chicken was also very satisfying ni betcha didnt know they have free wifi  so get cozy and stay awhile dont forget its byob,3
this place sucks my whole family threw up 2014  santa fe sucks 2009 santa fe was awesome dont eat here just go to in and out,0
this place is over rated having tysons chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy the turkey club and salad tasted like shit im never going back there ever again,0
the service was good but i cant say the same about the food  my food was super greasy and it just did not taste good  the prices are kind of high too,1
the food is always awesome the time it takes to come out is a little to long some times regardless its a great place to eat and healthynnedit wow the article about their cookie was interesting to good to be true,2
the only reason to go here was the excellent lowcalorie desserts it turns out they lied about the calorie content and they are actually highcalorie excellent desserts nncheck the stories in the newspaper for more info i will never go here again,0
i thought the frozen yogurt was good and the concept worked real well people easily got their  frozen yogurt in a timely fashion and wow they were packed,3
went bk 4 more trying abc burger veggie wrap fajita wrap  french toast  all was acceptable but as others have remarked on plain side  still seems wholesome though  not owned by a corp or chain  now they close 3pm everyday,2
my boyfriend and i frequent this place  we always order the brisket  however the last time there was a hair in his food  we did not complain we still came back a time after that and everything was fine  i think now i would chose a different korean bbq over this one,1
we waited for 20 minutes before we left  nobody so much as said hello have never gone back,0
wtf yo 5 people on line and service is madd slow for a busy crowd  never come at lunchtime 12 noon and expect quick service from this canes ever,1
great food and nice size portions prices are pretty good one of my new favorite places to eat,4
very fresh delicious chicken strips  the texas toast is soft and delicious with just a slight toasted top very well worth the stop in vegas before heading home to los angeles,3
for chef ami and chef rian introducing me to gourmet raw food here 4 years ago and changing my nutritional profile forever  this place gets 4 starsnnfor the regular though pricey grab  go raw food gourmet options available  4 starsnnchef amiel and chef rian get 10 stars though,3
one would think with semi mid prices like this the menu would be better printed and not missing letters food was meh service was meh got here a little after 930pm they close at 1030 and tildbus we need to be done by then yea prob not gonna come back after this,1
comfort food at a low price this place is packed consistently for obvious reasons so be prepared to wait because seating is limited,3
the wait staff was nice the service was good the food was as good as it always is at cpk if you like cpk you will like it here,2
the bar tenders are always super nice and friendly ive eaten at this location about ten times and the food is yum however i feel as though it is overpriced for the quality of their food i usually eat in the restaurant but the one time i ordered curb side togo they messed my order up,3
what a great place the location is tucked back in this little strip mall area the creamy broccoli soup was wonderful and i really enjoyed my mediterranean wrap will keep this on my list for future lunch spots,4
good food but the service is so disappointing its not worth the trip,0
i came in to get a pedicure withmy friend and we had a lively time great atmosphere with legit technicians,3
salted caramel brownie  need i say more,3
good desserts and nice cool calm atmosphere,3
i love the eclectic atmosphere i also love the assortment of desserts the lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast my favorite sweet is the salted caramel brownie soooooo yummy,3
good stuff,4
the sicilian sub here is to die for its made fresh right when you order the dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you dont want it end i live in surprise and still drive out to get this sub,4
i had a great first time experience here  and i hope it stays that waynni purchased their groupon for the 3 works washes  such a good deal  i go to get my car washed early  before work  around 730am  right when they opened  they did an excellent job i was very impressed,3
horrible service got there with 4 cars in front of me watched 14 cars go by that werent even in line apparently there needs to be someone with a degree to hand wash a car this is the 3rd time this has happened at this location no more i am done with this place,0
i dont why you would go there did see a few flamingos ducks and koi but i just dont see the point it may take 1015 minutes there are too many things to do on the strip i would avoid it,0
really good stuff  goos sushi great show great service ask for smatt  we had toms of fun,3
yummo but i wouldnt recommend the hooters roll,4
awesome checkouts so they are in a bad neighbourhood who cares take your high class behinds back to the high class ville this is the west side come in friendly associates see stephanie and leave easy fast clean and friendlyall i expect from a local walmart,3
great french inspired cuisine in a beautiful carefree desert setting  you truly do feel a world away here and at binkleys  as good as the other stuff is the biggest impression came from their inspired take on potato chips and fries,3
loved every bite and the staff was very friendly food came out quickly and tasted amazing i will surely become a regular,4
i visit this place about once a week i love the food and the healthy choices the lentil fatoosh salad is my new favorite you cant go wrong with the hummus the service is friendly and usually pretty fast i do wish there was some sort of dress code for the staff all that skin makes me lose my appetite,3
i usually really like pita jungle but this location seems to be poorly run plenty of empty tables but the food took forever and they claimed the kitchen was backed up stems on grapes in the salad graffiti in the bathroom disappointed,1
love the chicken humus lots of flavor and chicken is warm and tender you get 2 large pitas so i recommend splitting it with someone if you plan on getting a meal too,4
decent service and good food i like their happy hour i wouldnt come here if i was starving but portion sizes are adequate,3
chain restaurant location here in peoria has been on par with the others in the valley  service food and the wait are fairly consistent  omelets are what i recommend for this place who wouldnt have eggs at a place called the good egg nnpass on the pancakes  coffee could be improved,1
excellent sushi great service and good happy hour specials  it has a decent sports bar theme  i had my bachelor party here and even my friends who dont care for fish liked the place  i also go here for business dinnersnntry the ladybug roll just for the presentation,4
eh it was ok i got grossed out by the sushi chefs not wearing gloves it could of been the way their hands looked i dunno i am not sure if they should be wearing gloves  i wasnt impressed by the sushi the ambience was nice though,1
extremely poor seating layouts be prepared to pay 50 extra on top of your 1000 ticket for premium seats that are really the only seats that allow you to watch the movie without breaking your neck or sitting next to a wall,0
best theatre in pittsburghjust hate battling the traffic over the bridge to get here,3
we were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 930pm in northern scottsdale  the brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre,0
my wife and i looked forward to eating here for weeks we decided to get one of our favorites tonight bbq pork ribs let me say extremely disapointed neither one of us would recommend this place,0
the brisket was dry  the green beans were bland  the baked beans were watery  my daughter thought it was soup the brisket sandwich was okay mac and cheese good  fried okra was decent  nnthe sandwich and one side and drink was 8nnwould  i go back  no,1
i love the lunch specails here panang chicken is my favorite mmmm mmm and you can adjust your spice level i always have to tone it down just a little on the spice,3
awesome im here for business and planned on trying someplace new every dayi had thai house for lunch and im tempted to go back for dinnernnshrimp  chicken pad thai level 3 spiciness add pineapples service was quick food flavor robust,3
first time and food was good ribs fell off te bone and loved the baked beans,3
awesome service love the kona berry bowl,4
the slowest drive thru i have ever experienced i got in line at 1120 its now 1150 and i havent even made it to the speaker to take my order only 6 cars ahead of me ridiculous people seem friendly but are either short staffed or not very good at their jobs,0
disgusting behavior meat market i was sickened by the experience,0
sooo sad that this location has been closed now we have to drive to the one located in central phoenix,0
a very nice dinning experience,2
honestly the worst service ive ever had tried it more than once and i will never return,0
went there with a group of 6 on a sat night ordered a bunch of food most of it was good seafood dishes were weak little to no seafood n lots of sauce and bean sprouts service was bad seems like a bunch of young kids are running the place and really dont give a damn,1
all the food is awesome and most of it is homemade definitely not freezer food bartenders are super friendly beer selection is always changing and always above average awesome happy hour deals overall good atmosphere highly recommend it for drinking and eating,4
not very good my spring roll was bland and the peanut sauce was yucky vermicelli bowl was full of bean sprouts not noodles,1
place was dirty and did not serve vegetarians they guy said over the phone they did otherwise nice people,1
the burgers are pretty good especially the kobe burger theyve also got a decent selection of beers on tapnnthe mirage has some decent casual dining options all close by each other and blt burger is definitely a lot better than the dump with the long lines they try to pass off as carnegie deli,2
30 for a burger and milkshake tax and tip included my burger came out cooked incorrectly which is sucks considering how much my burger cost but mistakes happen and im not holding that against them the food was just bland even with an egg and bacon,1
surprisingly it was one of very few things open when i went out looking for food the service was good food was ok,2
2 wordsnfalafel burger,3
great little rest stop along the strip numerous selections in burger styles i highly recommend the chili burger,2
cool burger place at the mirage,4
eat lunch here today ordered a beer any tacos the tacos were good but the glass on my beer was broken and cut my lip the waitress brought me a new glass and no discount on my bill thanks for the cut lip,0
pricey but well its in the mirage so i guess i needs to be pricey great burger though if you are in the mirage try it out,3
we were going to a cirque du soleil show and came across blt burger the service was a bit slow but the burger and milkshake were great i had a tex mex burger with a vanillaoreo milkshake highly recommend both i would definitely go back,3
so so burgergood service i was not impressed w food,1
the burgers were okay they were a little bit on the drier side the burgers are a pretty good size you can get a burger combo with a side and alcoholic shake  the shake was pretty good  nnall in all the burger isnt anything crazy special there are better burger places on the strip,2
i always love am pm  came in here for a drink on my way home and some gas before it doubles yet again nncleanquick and lots of drink options,3
great place  great foodpiping hot and delicious  excellent service  house chianti was exceptional too  i would just request to sit on the left side when you come in  it looked to be quieter over there  the right side is adjacent to the open kitchen,4
ok so i usually write longer reviews but if you havent found or heard of this place yetwell i feel sorry for you awesome burgers awesome fresh fries great shakes and lemonades great service oh and super cheap i mean cheaper than mcdonalds garbage go animal style,4
tasty burgers shake and fries fries werent hot just warm,3
theres nothing fancy about rather plain actuallynclean inexpensive quick good nfairly healthy depending on your choicesni always just get a simple chicken teriyaki bowlngreat value,2
the cup o karma is such a neat coffee shop it has a lot of character and flair and a great iced coffee,3
the product was enjoyed by our pittsburgh family  the delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered cheese carmel and movie theatre were equally enjoyed  excellent place to do business with excellent service provided,4
mckoys is great  my coworkers and myself rarely miss a thursday night there we love the 50 cent wings but everything else is fantastic too great  food great atmosphere fantastic wait staff sometimes the only problem is finding a parking space,4
once again  my life is fresh and new all because we had the carpets cleaned i love brett he makes appts on short notice  shows up on time gets the work done and as the little midget lady said in poltergeist this house is clean,4
i like it no problems no issues,4
the coffee was hot and it was right around the corner from the condo grande bold every morning and didnt have to wait,3
had a great late night here molly was awesome i always love a dive bar and this guy takes the cake bras strung around the bar and a gorgeous gal makin the drinks this is a great spot to unwind after a long night at work,4
close and good lunch specials,2
we tried the plain jane pep pie the other day it was good but the speciality pizzas are the way to go i sampled a slice with mushrooms and caramelized onion and omg that was really good nnthe service is still top notch and the tuesday specials are great,4
arrived  615pm on sat without a reservation restaurant was fairly full  we were seated immediately though  no one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes  we got up and left once again without being acknowledged  disappointed,0
this restaurant has closed,2
i heard great things about this place which is why i was really looking forward to it  not sure if i hit them on an off night but the sushi was not good  i sure hope this isnt the best sushi in pittsburgh  didnt care for the atmoshpherekind of dingy,1
being from the midwest id never had del taco cant really say ive missed anything the bag probably had more flavor than the cold limp fries and unmelted cheese on the alllettuce chicken tacos,1
they have everything you need at a really good price dude has always been helpful not steering you to spend more money but getting the right stuff that will keep me coming back,4
food is just ok im not asking for culinary genius but something that isnt dry and hard to eat however iron city was half off so all was not lost waiters would take food around to every table asking who it belonged to this happened all night long,1
hey theyre gonna stop selling smokes soon,4
this place is always out of somthing the dunkin donuts on the east coast are 100 better,0
just passed by this dd the other week and sad to see it is now closed  blame the economy i suppose,2
being from the east coast i grew up on dunkin donuts so i should have a bias i do have to say however that im annoyed by how often my order gets messed up at this location and its usually when im 5 minutes down the road when i realize it im waiving the white flag on this one,1
good food and good sushi pad thai is good and portions are generous especially at dinner,3
the hero factory is 2 minutes from my office good for my foodie obsession bad for my waisteline  this place has absolutely one of the biggest heros ive had  10 will get you a hero and a drink  a little pricey but i can never eat the whole thing and that means lunch the next day too,3
pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in ny,2
they have the best springrollsnot fried  we also love their pad thaispiced to your palate,4
tons of classes and equipment indoor and outdoor pool and hot tubs great food in the cafe there are saunas and all kinds of other amenities in the locker room can get busy during peak times,4
ok for a quick lunch the server was nice but the food was average at best,1
toooooooo freaking bright   i am gettin lightbulb burn   servers sitting at the bar with their uniform  the bartender took 8minites to acknowled me   toooooooo bright not likelly to return,0
amazingnnmy husband and i both ordered the full tasting menu with one wine pairingnnthe dishes were very original and the presentation of each dish was extraordinarynneverything was beyond our expectationnnbravo,4
my husband and i were totally impressed by the dining experience everything from good quality presentation to service are top notch this is our first time dining at a michelin 3 star restaurant and joel robuchon definitely lives up to its reputation,4
how could any joel robuchon restaurants disappoint you needless to say  this was my best dining experience ever from food to service to ambiance  everything was superb,4
so fresh fantastic customer service as well i love that they have a drive thru too so lucky to live so close to this place,4
knocking you guys down a star the place has become a rather hit  miss as of my latest visit broth used to be richer portion more generous service has gotten a bit more prompt not enough to warrant the 3starnntime for a new backup pho place,1
tasty odd ambiance of 50s diner with mediocre service but good food id come again,3
its nice to have a family dinner but no kid menu makes it difficult aside from the extra expense the place is cool very 50s diner retro like food was good traditional vietnamese style very laid back and casual delicious spring rolls,3
cockroach crawled out of sprout plate killed it hesitated to stay but did they apologized replaced food charged me every cent for my food n togo dinner used to come here every week my fav pho diner but i think ill drive a little farther to chinatown from now on,1
i dont typically like asian cuisine but when i came here i had the shrimp pho it was so delicious if you like spicy and seafood this is your dish and service here is friendly and i love the decor its so cute,4
enjoy the vietnamese food the staff was friendly huge portions i would definitely get a couple of dishes for 5 friends and everybody share family style,3
nothing to rave about it was good my first time here,2
food is always good,0
service is good overall the have happy hour all day the food is not healthy but treats great the blue ribbon burger is delicious my bf liked his colossus burger the fries are decent  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them,2
i wasnt a fan of the place not trying to be rude the bread was stale when we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour our order had several mistakes too i would be hesitant to come back after this,1
i love stoping by anthology to pick up cards for special occasions and holidays  it is very charming shop run by lovely people  if you are looking for quality paper goods and the sweetest rubber stamps around anthology is surely the place for you,4
exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea  their sandwiches are good so are their soups but i never feel like anything is fresh  i know their soups come frozen and they just heat it  still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch,3
severely disappointed  tried it twice since i  had to use up gift certificates  will never go back again after the 2nd salad had long black hair in it even though i still havegift certificates  you couldnt give it to me free  hope your visit is better  there wasnt a negative or no star allowed,0
best place for healthy kids meals,3
great atmosphere in this place had a huge booth overlooking the bar had the prime rib and was happy with it good place a little pricey but you already knew that,3
i just enjoy eating at the keg,4
i really did like this place  the food is very good  i really liked the french onion soup  their burgers are great as is the steak  the prices are a good value and i will be going back,3
i went for the first time today for their sunday allyoucaneat brunch and it was excellent ang sarap they had everything from tapa to tocino to arroz caldo and longganisa i cannot wait to return and try some of the items on the lunch or dinner menu,4
this is one cool place  i love it and the clothes and shoes  my nieces loved it two real dogs to play with  today was only my third time visiting this store and just my second visit since the change over,4
went here for lunch and the lunch specials were so affordable our server was a sweet heart and the fod was very good,3
two words mango habanero nnim a regular on tuesdays for 45 cent wings but damn do i have to bring my own bottle of ranch sauce in my purse since they charge 50 per little bitty serving i guess,3
everything was delicious  my caesar salad delisch and so large filet mignon was done to perfection and it had some rub on it that tasted very good my friend had salmon and raved about it great place with kobe beef,4
great food amazing service from our server brent was superbnnarrowhead grill is the nicest place west of central,3
3 measly chicken fingers on a pile of soggy fries how do you mess up chicken fingers 9 bucksno thank you,1
the pizza is great and its so original the price is good and the food is great but dont ask them for ranch it will highly offend them they say that people use ranch to cover up the taste of bad pizza the cheese is amazing,4
i have to agree with taric ws review,1
its cheapnot the best food not the best quality but its fine to eat when youve been walking around shopping for 5 hours i finally tried the meatballs and they were alright but i wouldnt call them good,2
clean and friendly what else can you saynni diddd buy some filet mignon that was at a price that made the food even better jnnr,3
good ambience looks like the cheesecake factory this place is super busy on the weekends so call ahead got the feel of an upscale olive garden not impressive but not disappointing either,2
tried them twice now and as far as italian goes pretty bland  service was kind if stuffy too,1
this is not olive gardeni dont mean that in a bad way here it is a little more classy more relaxing and great food nice place to take a date or the wife to enjoy a quiet meal and just relax servers are very good and nice here,4
netflix is awesome i am not sure how renting videos could be any easier i just wish they would rent some games to me as well oh wellnnupdate they never have any new content regarding feature films,2
decent food here but come on is it really the food you come here for i like coming here when i have my irish cravings and need a good ol glass of guiness,2
i live within 10 minutes walking time of this place and finally made it in there today with some friends after a brown bag gangplanknni got the veggie pies as they were the only thing vegetarianbut they were delicious its easy to miss this place but worth finding and trying,2
incredible  very friendly service and wonderful food  my husband and i tried the brown stew chicken and the oxtail  both excellent  prices were very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food  a must try,4
first time i came here i ordered beef patties  they didnt have any cooked so i bought them frozen it was a bit of inconvenience but it was still good ntoday i came once again no cooked beef patties and no frozen patties wth guess ill find a new caribbean restaurant,1
pasta was good wine was good but i cant trust an italian restaurant that puts herseys syrup on their tiramisu sorry,2
we were down in the area for the arts festival and the park toward the point was all torn up and under construction not sure whats going on there but hopefully it will be an improvement,2
i was very excited to get the opportunity to play shadow this week  it was everything i expected it to be  great layout perfect fairways and greens very friendly staff and great forecaddies  if you get the opportunity you have to play it,4
good fast foodnni stop here every so often when im walking on craig for an inexpensive but filling meal go for the sub combos easily the best deal on the menu and make sure you ask them to toast it,2
purchased a six inch with combo at this subway and i was charged 850 the soda and the drink was half the price of my sandwich when i went to a different subway for the same meal i was charged 630 wont be going back to this subway,0
i dunno i was drunk when i got there  its amateur night there every night they have a mechanical bull  you might find yourself looking up at the sky wondering if it was 8 seconds  trust me it wasnt,1
had a really great time here tons of people and really good music and the thing i remember most clearly was that there was no line for the womens bathroom maybe girls are just lower maintenance or more considerate than in nyc but i was so impressed with the lack of a bathroom line,3
terrible service very unprofessional would never go back chose a different location in the epicentre if you want a good time and to be treated well,0
we didnt eat we didnt dance all we did was drink a few beers  our bottles of beer were not cold enough  neither were the drafts  its my fault for not complaining because they could have accommodated us in someway  but even still 4 different beers 4 times not in temp,0
the only reason i ever come this theater is for movies i want to see in 3d imax nprosn   imaxn   cleann   close to homen   nconsn   popcorn sucksn   way overpriced concessions  n   seats are comfortable but narrower than an airplane seatnni will drive a little further for a harkins over amc any day,1
stopped by on the recommendation of a friend it looked a bit pricy at first but it turned out they actually had an unadvertised lunch special entree with two sides for under six dollarsnnthe staff was greatvery attentive and ill definitely be back to try the rest of the sides,4
i had the special a chicken sandwich and it was okay  ive only been once and it seemed a little priceybut i could be wrong  i will probably head back sometime though  good place to play trivia on tuesday,1
film selection here is not quite as good as at concord mills but the theaters offer a smaller crowd clean theaters and most of the big hits  its a chain theater so not really anything else of note  average size screens average size seats typically horrendous prices,2
pizza is okay not the best very rude ppl asked for a slice they didnt have a slice i had to buy a whole pizzashould consider taking the slices of the menu it happend one time now a second time will never go bak here again,0
the look of the place is great of course it is its vegas babynni just really hated how they had everyone wait in line for over an hour even though they were already opennnplus 40 cover i dont know if paid that full amount but my guy friends didit sucks,1
we tried this twice since it was in our hotel it was kind of ghetto and trashy and the people werent very friendly we were basically told we couldnt stand anywhere except the dancefloor nice music and free drinks some nights but otherwise not worth it there are so many better clubs closeby,1
yummy pizza the garlic dipping sauce and sweet pizza sauce go well together it was delivered hot and crisy in half the time they said super nice woman who answered the phone,3
yelp reviews made this place sound neat the place has no ventilation  i walked in for 30 seconds and walked right out  i am pretty sure i got cancer,0
i love you bevmo nnthis place has everything you need to make some righteous drinks everyone that works here is very friendly and helpful i am here at least once a week stocking up when they have sales last week they had a sale on wines that were buy one get one for 5 cents what a bargain,4
ordered the roasted veggie and the one veggie both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick the garlic knots are nothing to rave about but the house chips i really likedsmoky with a slight kick good alternative to dominos so well be back for sure,4
decent nothing to write home about good place for an appetizer and beer however the main menu has an identity crisis bar and grill is not fried rice or egg rolls maybe dumplings not so much sometimes small bar drama does not need to be shared with all,1
as i am writing this review i have yet to see my food we have been given complimentary chips  salsa however i have seen 2 other tables get their food before me this is terrible serviceplease beware of this chilis as you will wait for food for it to be warm,0
i heard this is called the shtake factory thats accurate,1
food are little bit salty but the service is great if you prefer something more special to try than buffet stratta would be a not bad to try i highly recommended the tata beef appetizer,3

good hotel nothing special or fancy but very clean and very friendly staffnrestaurant is completely overpriced food is so so nmenu has not changed since at least 7 month could be longer,2
i suppose thats what you can expect for the very reasonable prices food heavy on fat light on taste and cavernous decornngood for a group looking to eat quality food on the cheap but not for much else,1
great food a lot of different appetizers were given this restaurant follows a typical 3 course italian dinner with an antipasto primo and secundo an antipasto and secundo complement each other well if you want to eat meat great food,4
classic drink food just noodles no frills open late cheap as dirt served super quick in massive heartstopping portions i dont know for sure that its msg laden but the hallucinations suggest that yes,2
despite us both getting a little bit sick the next day the food was delicious  not sure how you rate a restaurant when that happens but we will probably go backnnedit  went back  delicious as always  waitress was nice but probably too sick to be working,3
we took home a baguette and three fantastic portions of the charcuterie plus homemade cornichons for 1920 nnbtw the today show was visiting from nyc when i was there i love this place,4

been here a couple times  this place has great deserts but the service is lame slow non attentive and rude  this place can easily be 4 stars if not for the service,1
cool atmosphere nice hot chocolate and in one word  chocolate heaven,3
didnt have a chance to try it unfortunately we waited around twenty minutes at our table and no one came to take our order but there were five servers standing around chatting at the front so we left  keep in mind ive worked as a server for over five years,0
excellent food and atmosphere  all tapas we tried were amazing olives spanish tortilla cod fish fritters fideosserrano and cheese  churros were a hit  paella was mediocre,4
have you ever asked a cab driver to take you to a good place to party this was my first time and most likely the last,1

as a bar its pretty decent as for the food well if youre going to prepare all your food in a microwave can you at least hide it somewhere in the back i would also appreciate it if the waitresses could wash their hands in between handling money and preparing my nuke nachos,2
the veal tartar was off the hook and the service was really good  great wine selection as well  if you find yourself in montreal this will be a wonderful treat,3

excellent brunchbreakfast  this place offers a variety a breakfast dishes that taste amazing  i am not a breakfast fan but this place changed my mind,4
one of the larger second cup around  always tons of fresh goodsnncan get busy on sundays where students come to study,2
not worth the cost of the plate paid 38 for a chicken on a plate no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people i was shocked high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served,0
familyfriendly affordable prices lots of patrons but food was pretty average,2
second time here  great selection of brews but the service is aloof  not sure if it is because were americans but we werent loudobnoxious  just out to get a few brews before the night,2
fun restaurant great for the cause you are going for simple setup and service will of course vary depending on the night as many do it out of pure generosity,2
yummy great salad bar but wish they had more veggie meat options though,2
what the heck is wrong with all the five star reviewers went here last night no sense of hygiene uneaten bread is reused for next table hot sauce is put on with a brush directly onto eaten food without being washed or changed between tables yuck lost my appetite here,0
delicious and the owner is fabulous  very proud of his restaurant and the long family ties to it,4

amazing bagels it is by far the best bagel you can have i always eat at least one before i even leave the store nnin montreal there is always a debate about who the best but for me i give my vote to fairmount in addition to the great taste it remains soft even after i freeze it for a month,3
cadre sympathique bon service et surtout de bonnes biu00e8res,3
had fried tofu fried pork peanut butter dumplings and eggplant the fried foods were dry and tough pretty much every dish here can be found in a much better version elsewhere in montreal only try this if youre desperate for chinese the pickings are admittedly slim in this neighbourhood,1
in a city like montreal you have to have great food to survive  unfortunately this place focuses all energy on appearance and being trendy with the food taking second stage  unless youre the type of person who just wants to be seen its not worth the long line,1
incredible food my boyfriend said he had the best benedict ever the benedict are a must and smoothies are amazing just get it all,4
go to brunch place in montreal  dont know if its worth the wait though  go during the week if you can when its less busy  we did and we ended up running into georges st pierre  eggs benedict and gsp what more can you ask for,3
we had the 7course tasting menu portions were large for tasting menu which surprised us taste  was not delicate and presentation was mediocre too much butter we expected their soufflu00e9 but it was not part of the tasting menu service was good especially the manager was very nice and professional,2

i just went to this place and i have no idea that its a vegetarian food but guess what i love it the food is so good the curry sauce is so delicious i will go back there again next time when i go back to montreal i really recommended this place im thai so i know what im talking about,4
pretty good supermarket in terms of selection otherwise i thought it was a bit overpriced and was disappointed in the apparent freshness and selection of the items in the bakery section small wine selection but the wines in stock included a few decent picks,2

great new saq the 4th within walking distance to my house hey if youre going to have a drinking problem have it in the plateau,3
great place fantastic patio and the prices seem fair  sitting out front is also pleasant in the sunshine as the back patio is almost all shade  so many tourist traps around this area we found this one listed in frommers and were not disappointed,3
in summer its a great place if youre looking for a terrasse  they also have live jazz music which adds a nice touch  the pizzas arent that great but the crepes and salads are usually a decent bet,2

schwartzs is good but not great nnthey are famous for being condescending but i feel this is mostly an act to keep up schwartzs reputation,2
i really hate to say this but this place is a bit overrated my sandwich was mostly gristle and fat i had better smokes meats the last time i was in ottawa i suspect there are better places in montreal or hopefully these guys just had an off day,1
how can you not be a fannnits an institutionnnonly complaint is sometime out of items from menu like poutine gravy but if that is the worst thing in your life you need to goto haiti for awhile,3
this grocery store gets 2 stars just for being open 24 hours  ni only shop there if its after midnight when the other grocery stores in the area have closed nn overpricedn very annoying security guys follow you around the storen limited selection,1

good ambient and waiters are friendlynbeen a soon of a portuguese family i was a little disappointed with the black cod i ordered missing a little taste and definitely not enough sides availablenwould give another 12 if was available,2
tourist trap pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food service and atmosphere i dont mind paying more money for quality but things were far from exceptional a 12oz beer was 10 and steak and fries was 30 the girls were nice to look at but nothing more,1
good price good place nvery easy to find what you are looking for and they have something for every budget so its greatnthe only down side would be the locationnvery hard to find parking during the day,3
the waiter we got was drunk for one thing for the other he treated my group of people terribly he saw us as mouth breathing americans and even told mesorry we dont have any burgers or hot dogs we left shortly afterwards i would not recommend this place for anyone,0
the coffee was just ok but the crepes make up for it many varieties of very tasty crepesnnbest thing about this place is you can order your crepe from the street like a food truck watch them make it and be on your way,2
good servicenot so much for the foodnntwo steaks ordered medium rareone arrived medmedwellthe other was blue rare at bestpretty much rawnnnoisy and busy but our server was great im sure of we were not pressed for time she would have done the best to mack our food right too,1
came here on a saturday night during labour day weekend the service wasnt good but the place was busy we were seated and it took about 20 minutes until a server waited on us i had the braised lamb shank and it was okay,2
visiting for a week on business great local beer definitely worth checking out if youre in the area i recommend the honey  brown they also had a local band playing offers seating inside and two balconies,4

spacious  clean nno refrigerator or safe on the roomndid not loose anything though nbring your swimwear with you  the pool is ok and fairly large  4 people could do lapses with a bit of maneuvering,3
interesting place to say the least crowd was good and lively and the beer was priced fairly they have a foozball table and a good selection of music,2
1250 pitchers of molson ex staff are very friendly and welcoming and really good pub food,4
this is easily my favourite place to eat in montreal let alone the best thai ive ever had everytime i order a veggie pad thai elsewhere i constantly compare it to bangkok and how id just rather be sitting in that depressing foodcourt,4
i went there once nothing special i think soup and noodles across the street really kills their business,1
skip this place   sweet owner good wine great attitude however extremely sub par food  red sauce was ehhhh at best  fish  of the day was unimpressive and the accompanying salad had wilted greensnnwe didnt risk dessert  you can do better,1
really really heavy food  i like meat and they do it well but there is no balance to their meals  an experience undoubtably but this place really comes across as a gimmick and not a restaurant run by professionals  a salad on the menu would be nicennthat said the service was spectacularly good,1
are you kidding me with the salt  ordered the steak main course with side of fries  could not believe how salty it wasnnenjoyed the oysters the most  but even with this found bits of shell in my last oyster nntoo much hype  was an early fan but for what you pay for not going back,1
had buffalo chicken sandwich it was not that bad   my friend ordered chicken tenders it was horrible   good place for people who had drinking   nice environment,1
very good french crepes  i had the chocolate covered strawberries and banana  sweet deliciousness,3
nice drink menu and a great balcony with a view of the city much better than the clubpub options down the street very trendy vibe but worth it to avoid loud club beats on a weekend,2
la bouffe est bonne mais je ny retournerai plus u00e0 cause de la malpropretu00e9 cest un des pires du00e9liquants selon les inspecteurs du gouvernement,1
the chicken shwarma sandwich was pretty good but not the best ive had  the sandwich was dripping with grease which might freak other people out but im ok with it  the potatoes with the garlic cream sauce is off the chain though,2
a montreal mainstay if you are looking for chicken schwarma forget the chain restos and head to boustans,4
grossnnbut thats what you do when nothing else is open at 2 amnni am happy i didnt get sick the next day,0
very good place  the food was good  the dancers made it fun  a great place for a group,3

nice location too bad westmount park is just a bit too far to make it before your ice cream melts delicious excellent ice cream and nice place to sit and enjoy,4
i always like going therethe food is always good and service pretty goodnlove the outside terrace,3
expensive and the service is hit or miss yet the food is good,2
i personally thought this place was terrible i ordered 2 cheese slices and i could barely eat it i felt that the cheese and sauce tasted cheapi certainly didnt think it was tasty or anything like that,0
my fiancee and i ate here last night and the food was outstanding but the service was shite  if you are not a celebrity or do not have a large party of spenders the staff has little time for you  there are not a lot of vegetarian options and the menu is written all in italian just fyi,1
meatballs were fantastic service was great the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty,2
spinning classic 80s and 90s music all night,2
overpriced and nothing to write home about the place was amazing when it opened in the 80s or 90s but like many places that have become staples they no longer try and theres nothing worse than cynical overpriced food,0
this place was great not a fancy place by any means but the guy was very nice the croissants were delicious and everything was so cheap in comparison to other places in montreal would highly recommend it if you are looking for an authentic french croissanterie experience,4

slow serversnnsoda was only refilled when i yelled out to the servernnnothing too special,0
friendly service and a good place for a burger thumbs up,3
pretty fun spot food is not amazing but its outdoor seating makes up for that cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good i think appetizers and drinks are swcs specialty,2
although the food here has always been impressive on many visits i have to say im a bit dissapointed to see my favorite dish go from 1795 to 27 in the space of a couple years,2
this is coming from someone with a lebanese background this is hands down one of my favourite lebanese restaurants outside of lebanon lol a bit pricey but definitely worth it staff are super nice food is super amazingni highly recommend this place,4
service is a hit or miss as is their seafood fortunately its a byow and their pizza is delicious real pizza oven,2

i liked it the food was good they had really nice samosas i would have to eat again to confirm 5 stars but the prices seemed right to me very nice,3
good food  extremely good value  a little more spice than i can handle in dishes i wouldnt expect it fromnnslightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and its no longer on the menu nnid have given five stars  but we ordered rice and it never came,3
who would have thought a japanese owned patisserie in montreal  i had a pleasure of having wonderful macha flavored french pastries at a friends house  it reminded me of shiseido parlor in tokyo  super rich in flavor yet light and delicate  i cant wait to go and check it out in person,3
the burgers are as good as one could hope for the price and the setting sure makes for good conversation i like the fact that its not a chain fast food place but its missing some beer variety ie other than molsonlabbatt and the fries could really be improved,2
great place lots of parking lots of choices for fruits and veggies they have a nice veggyvegan sectionnnthe prices are a little cheaper than the downtown provigo which is greatnnthey also have a student discount on certain days,3
do not order sushi from here the rolls are 3km in diameter and the soy sauce is so salty you may dehydrate on the spot they use chicken fried rice in their sushi  chow mein is also questionable save your money and your taste buds,0
super nice setting large outdoor terrace large well lit and decorated dining room excellent  and experienced service high class nnfood is fresh classical and very well prepared nnwine list is priced ok with many popular choices,3
excellent italian restaurantntheir table dhote is a nice value  usually i have their excellent mussels to start and then one of their veal specials   dessert is so sonanother time  i had a scrumptious lamb shank dish  however it is rarely on the menunsuperior service,4
pour du poulet toujours juteux et genereux et une livraison fiable oui certains mentionnent la dame particuliere au telephone mais elle fait partie du charme  noubliez le sthubert,3

a great local pub with friendly staff  most nights have live music  the food menu isnt bad but wish they had a few more healthy options,3
the food here is actually pretty good but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner rajiv is not around and forget about the delivery the food is always cold and then they blame you if they cant find the place  they really need to work on the service,0
the new owners are wrecking this place just returned to montreal for a short vacation and the staff are way overworked wont be going back  its better in my memories the food has gone down hill,1
wasnt the ownership change at the time in 2004 it was the cook and recipe change that killed it went there for lunch new owners horrible zero stars,0
checked in for a long weekend its nice but nothing specialthey deserve 3 stars not more the staff is ok not as friendly or professional they should be especially front desk nconvenient located next to the airport so you dont waste the time to travel to,2
a consistently highly mediocre experience never great but never horrible the beer however is on par but at a price 10  for 24oz on the plus side if youre there to watch a game you will get a good view of a tv they are everywhere plus it not being a brasserie or bar you can bring the kids along,2
mediocre food but great service lots of comfy seating with great views of different tvs and games,2

service is slow the food is ok i ordered a small fruit bowl and it turned out to be canned fruit dont order that it is just gross,0
the breads prepared foods and cheeses are definitely worth checking out if youre hungry they make very good sandwiches vincenzos carries a lot of specialty items but sometimes one can find the more common items much cheaper at a regular grocery store,4
this place is amazing soo much to choose from love the hot sauce section the cheese section is unreal and they will let you try anything overall a really great store,4

the food is pretty good but i dont understand why their lunch specials are so expensive i once ordered a pad thai to take home to my husband after i dined with a friend at lunch and ended up like 40 in the hole brutal,1
chicken schwarma here is fantastic best in town dont add onions though pita chips and hummus are also great,3
its my favorite thai place in tempe  sometimes there is a wait but its always worth it  my favorite is the siamese basil chicken,4
blows badly its like new jersey meets new jerseys ugly kid brother smh,0
a nice grand park thats perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic  portions of it have dense trees and its nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city  this place is worth the visit,3

nice convenient location in uptown i went in just to see what the deals were and what was in the premade entrees section of the store there was a pretty good selection but nothing that really grabbed my attention so i walked out and went to a more appetite appeasing restaurant,2
probably the only karaoke that has updates of songs and the rooms are clean and affordable if your looking for a good time with friends this is the best place to go nfood like drinks and snacks could be a little cheaper but then again there are complimentary chex mix and the platters are quite huge,4

sad experience  went to the drive in at 10pm and was told they could not fill an order of their 10 for 1099  they only had 3 pieces of chicken  thats not enough to feed both people in the car so we just left  the employee made it pretty clear he wouldnt make more,0

this place is in my neighborhood and i decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like little caesars or something the pizza was mediocre and the price was high perfect the veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good,1
this place really needs to work on their service hiring cashiers is one thing training them to give good service makes a business so much better im pretty sure this places management doesnt really care about customers more focused on loss prevention and keeping the store running,1
pretty decent car wash for the price  they were happy to go back over a couple of places that they missed on my car,2
the team at dannys did a really mediocre job on my car wash barely vacuumed and i noticed after i left that they missed standard things like my side view mirrors the staff is also disengaged and unfriendly i bought a groupon with three car washes so i have two left but wouldnt return otherwise,1

not very good,0
food was good but not great location is very cool in the town center think big white columned building with southern looking squarennno lunch specialsyou paid dinner prices,1
great food reasonable portions and prices but the service each time ive been here a dude brings out the food guesses at which dishes he is holding and stands at the end of the table yelling them out until they are claimed service is one of the very few things that they dont have quite right,2
we eat here almost every month excellent veal and pasta dishes pizza and likes the seafood salad,3
i was really disappointed in the service i received for the price i paid paid like 40 for a car wash my car needed it they gave me decent wash but that wasnt what i paid for not going back,1
i order for my employees he put too much broccoli and not enough shrimp he needs yo be fair  not much happy,0
had lunch here today at best its alright i wouldnt want to rush back here anytime soon though typical american food check loud atmosphere check average waiters check,2
chinese run crepesnhmmmnnbrisk service balanced seasonings and light creperienworked well as a second breakfast before running out back on the townnnthe decor was minimalist and tasteful great work in a very demur and nonostentatious mode,3
been here several times now and its still just ok folks i work with like to frequesnt this place but i am just not as enthusiastic as they are ngrilled cheese is pretty good but ill be darned if i am going out to eat just to have grilled cheesenncall me crazy,1
long long long wait in drive thru  for hard freaking chicken strips  overpriced  overrated  food was either overcooked or under a heat lamp all day   a waste of a good location they could put a better fast food joint,0

went climbing here about 4 months ago and used their rented shoes left with a minor blisterlike object on my 2nd toe and to this day i still have it if you can bring your own shoes unless you want some nasty looking growth on your toe,0
and empty club determined by friend that was already there when we showed up and empty line and i need to buy bottle service to get in  no thanks  this place is awful,0
i love this place  it caters to my ocd  i like to have things in places where i can find them  my hubby is always amazed whatever he is looking for in our home if he asks me i know exactly where it is  i am now organizing the twins bedroom they have tons of stuff that need to be contained,3
tasty and the lunch menu makes it affordable,3

love the food here the portion is not big but always enough for me i always like to order their todays special  never disappointed,4
one of montreals last great spots to catch independent films and an excellent way to support montreals documentary film industry,3
very colorful especially if you want to smoke weed surrounded by a bunch of weirdos playing african drumsother than that it is rather boring,2
just discovered this place food was really good nothing out of the ordinary food wise but it was really good and cheap the staff was super helpful and friendly a great first experience we will be back,3
i dont get what all the craze is about my burrito was just okayi had better burritos in boston which doesnt really say much about haberneros its better than all the chain burrito places but it doesnt leave me saying wow that was good,2
we each ordered the south point cut done medium rare with me opting for blackened cajun style  our dinners included a house salad tossed tableside a bread basket and a choice of potato mashed for me baker for ann or rice pilaf  the prime rib was smaller than at carve but pretty good,2
restaurant is nice and service oknas a meat lover i never tasted anything that horrible as their prime rib cowboy entree servingnchoose another restaurant npaul,1
their products are good however the customer service is not ive been in a handful of times over the years and each time the employees act like they have a stick up their asses  ill go spend my money somewhere else,1
had an awesome first experience she was nice gentle and kept up a little chit chat with me to fill in the awkward silence haha cheap too for 20 i got my eyesbrows and lip done,4

there the meat counter is the best of all to me also have variety of collection very competitive and active most of the time i went for taking their meat section being fresh i love it,3
i ordered the arroz caldo chickenshitiake mushroomsgreen onions in congee it was very tasty  my friend ordered the palabok which was unfortunately not so great  the cakes that ive tried are stupendously moist light and flavorful  most pleasantly suprised,2
everything we had was very well done very good fresh pasta and the salads are excellent very friendly staff and great service it is a very small restaurant super cozy so be prepared for that  also no liquor for sale but it is bring your own wine,3
positively the snobbiest starbucks ive ever been to get over yourselves and crack a smile for goodness sake,1
like most of this franchise the service sucks slooooooowwwww and the food is no better than mediocre  add to this a lack of talent and you basically have bennigans,0
food was decent drink was yummyservice couldve been a little better but for a sports bar it is overall okay,2
while this branch is small in size it is really convenient and has a great selection of books and dvds they are only 7 computers but they are all new and the branch has had a few upgrades in the past year the staff is helpful and the branch has super fun holiday decor for all the different seasons,3
prices are a bit steep 3 each for a small cup of hot chocolate and a small cup of cappuccino but theyre strong in tastenna good stop to make after visiting the basilica,3

i have been a few times with my wife and by myself i love it it seems clean and the help is sincere and accommodating the chicken is good and spicy,3
great place tons of meat if youre in to grilled meat this is the place for you a bit on the pricey side especially with all the buffets in vegas  good service and atmosphere a great place for a group dinner,3
not impressed the meats were very salty no refills on soft drinks the filet was really dry we were celebrating a birthday and the dessert wasnt comped extremely over priced nnot worth your money i went to the fiesta casino buffet and paid 699 and had better cuts of beef than here,0
extremely over priced  every meat dish was either overcooked undercooked or too fatty  every meat dish was toooo salty  the only thing decend was the sausage but sausage is decent at mcdonalds toonn800 for a slice of cake to boot  70 a head  no way no how  and ill tell others to stay away as well,0
wonderful steaks with salad bar thats fresh  theres so much to choose from,4
i love this place but be careful you will overeat also making reservations is better than not and eat the meat and not the salad bar or you wont get your moneys worth,4
salad bar is awesome with everything you could possibly want  the top sirloin was my favorite but everything was wonderful  the chocolate moose cake was to die for  good service and atmosphere maybe just a tad on the pricy side,3
for french food it was a regular food not bad and nothing out of the ordinary,2
very inconvenient location its like in a basement area really is a shitty locationnnin order to sit down and watch sports you need minimum 50 order per person  everyday all daynncashiers were assholes to mennworst sportsbook ive been to in vegas,0
i give this location no stars cuz they are horrible at there job took them 15 min to make a latte and my girlfriends iced coffee taste horrible,0
this starbucks is awful they dont listen when youre ordering dont apologize for having to repeat yourself 5 time their rude and unworthy of my business,0
one of my favorite places to eat i come here maybe once every other week i would go more often if it was closer to my house their ingredients are organic and always fresh it used to be more consistent but i feel as though they have been slacking lately otherwise i would have given them 5 stars,3
this is not the best galatto in the valley although the view of the fountain is nice it was way over priced for the lack of flavor it wasnt bad but is there such a thing as bad galatto,1
ive been eating here for almost three years and ive never been disappointed not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store best hot dogs in tempe id choose thirsty dogs over teds every time less wait and juicier dogs,4
ok i am giving them 4 stars because i like the artichoke appetizer that much it is absolutely delicious nnthe menu is very boring the rest of the food doesnt inspire mennthe artichoke appetizer is to die for with a bottle of white wine heaven,3
i used to love this place but it has quickly gone downhill as it gained popularity  long waits and the quality of foods is submcdonaldsquality  barf,0
just got some ink from eric ayala vintage cowgirl its great nice guy and a great artist will be back for more,4
wow this place has changed tonopah rob might want to take a bite of some humble pie and worry about what his own farm is doing i am done with the smugness that has over taken this place,0
just has an appointment with luis  great job did an awesome color works wonders with blondes most people make me too brassy and cut and threw in a great style definitely going back to him,4
best place to work great atmosphere and coworkers the rockstars of old town ask for albert and mention yelp for a 20 discount existing client or not,4
this location has the worst employees i have seen at any subway location ever they all seem super bummed out to be there and waiting on their next break not very pleasant or friendly i keep going back since i work right next door and plus subway is always a good easy lunch no matter what location,2
this place is horrible  the food is raunchy  it comes out cold and the restaurant was so cold inside i wore a winter jacket in the summer  avoid this place unless you are almost starving,0
i had the fish tacos hubby had a bacon cheeseburger and the kids had corn dogs the fish tacos were very tasty,3
decent bar nice patio though it can be loud on ewash  good place to relax with a nice beer however i was disappointed they did not have more belgians after being places like brasserie v  it would fit well with the decent bars on willy street but has the bonus of being pornshop adjacent,2
i love this place  the pastries are the best ive had  the owners are a delight  always great service always great food  i know when i want to impress dinner guests we make sure we get pastries from here  everyone raves about them  i really enjoy spending my money with mom  pop places like this,4
enjoyed the lychee tea love that each teapot is unique and their cookies were delicious,2
i called a week later to see if they could update my gel nails  they were rude on the phone and were going to charge me way more than any other place  i wont be going back there again,0
lifesavers short on time and desperately in need of gel mani and a pedi they had one person do my mani while the other did my pedi thanksnsept 2014 update it really depends when you go and who you get its good in a pinch but the last time i had a bad pedi and not so happy,1
great job the guy took his time and did exactly what i wanted i got a fill and gel polish change on my toes,4
went for the first time tonight did not like the feel or decor tons of tacky easter decorations everywhere even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good,1

good beer and decent food,2
the place is clean and well run and the food is pretty good  we happened to eat here during a happy hour special and everything we ordered appetizers and entrees were all half pricenna nice variety of food at a resonible price,3
the girl behind the counter was very welcoming and pleasant she asked us how our weekend was going  a little thing that goes a long way for a quality experience the restaurant was very clean which was confirmed by their 990 sanitation rating on the wall great place  we will definitely come back,4
love this place but so sad with their limited and confusing hours of operation  the website and voice message give conflicting hoursdays of operation  ultimately the kitchen closes by 6 pmsuper tough to make dinner plans,2
was here with the hubby  great service,2
overpriced even on things you can get the same of at walmart or food4less they try to upsell you at the ice people think its free when they ask if you would like ice but its not ill start shopping here again when i am rich,1
inexplicably whole foods switched out their baked goods supplier and now they dont have decent chocolate or almond croissants anymore   now i have to go to panera bread starbucks or the local bakeries   bad move i hear that a lot of customers are complaining about this,1
took clients there for lunch had a good lunch and left a nice tip i left something very important and called i spoke to the manager and she promised to mail it to my home address i never received the item very dissappointed,0
just like my home hot dogs in hermosillo by the universitynthey are rich and gigantic so show up hungry,4
cuban sandwich is soooo awesome  fresh pork loin and great ham comlimented by the spicy kosher pickles and pressed neatly but stuffed between two halves of a fresh roll  i would do this one again for sure,4
ordered a hot sandwichand 28 minutes later and after asking 3xs i finally got it  way to long to have to wait for lunch,0
i eat here twice a month the food is always good  i usually sit at the bar and the bartender always takes great care of me i think his name is ben very good  reliable and considtant,3
ok bbq we had sausage and bbq sandwich as well as a burger they were all pretty good my favorite part of the meal was the bbq nacho for a appetizer,2
this is an above average sports bar chain with fantastic chicken wings i like stopping here for lunch occasionally i dont know if id ever bother late night,2
my only complaint is they are pricey compared to other quality sushi restaurants ie sakana on hayden and indian school but the food was good service was good and the ambience is comfortable,2
delicious  theres one in la that we used to go to and the az one is just as good even though were landlocked here  must gets are then  spicy tuna on crispy ricen  marinated codn  baked crab hand roll in soy paper,4
this marshalls is great for dresses and accessories i loved shopping here when i lived in charlotte they always have a wide variety of dresses and you will always get a good deal a large portion of my closet is from this marshalls and everything ive bought from there is still in great shape,3
went here because they had a sign that there was a brunch turns out its only saturday and sunday the food was cafeteria like for 18 each good service from our waiter youre killing me lvh with your restaurants benihanas was the only awesome restaurant we are going elsewhere right now for dinner,1
had dinner here last night with a girlfriend and had a wonderful time greatly enjoyed the meal the wine and the company the liver pate is wonderful the popovers sublime and the meat cooked perfectly my only regret its pricey or i would frequent this place,4
great simple affordable and authentic nuff said nnthe entrance is misleading there is more seating in the back,4
all the offices are packed with people and is never easy to get an apointment right away the front desk people are rude and lack of compassion and understanding and they just want to have a reason to reschedule patients i never go back to this practice again,0
simply delicious its a small place with big flavors if your craving a satisfying asian noodle soup than this is one of the best places in montreal for it service is also quick,3
this is our goto southside bar wings are great burgers are excellent service is incredible  jim erin kelly josh all amazing people the 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and weve rented for parties too we love the bbt,4
called to place a catering order and they rudely asked me to call back in 20 minutes bc they were busy wtf how about ill call one of the other 20 qdobas in town to give my money to,0
a friend turned me on to juju berri and im hooked the yogurt is yummy especially the regular and green tea flavors the toppings are awesome lots of fresh fruit and decadent candy goodness too ive tried some of the other yogurt places in town but none i have tried compare to juju berri,4
this place is okay  the crepes are pretty good  ive had the turkey and avocado one and a veggie one  the spinach salad with dried cranberries and almonds has a poppyseed dressing that is way too sweet  i guess i should i ask for it on the side,2
this is a weekly place for  us same two servers mother and daughter this is more of a hang out dont go for a parisian experience dressed in your sunday best its more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time,3
some of the poorest customer service i have ever experienced but the crepes and drinks were very good,2
good crepes fast and friendly service we tried a crepe from the sweet and from the savory side chicken supreme crepe and nutella crepe a great place to get your crepe fix regardless of what youre in the mood for,3
great iced coffee the chai iced vanilla tea is also to die for the place is not very big but its its nice and they make good use of the space i also enjoy all the local art work it gives the space character i will be back for sure i wish the place was open late though oh well,4
2 words awe some nngreat fish  chips great po boys so far have loved everything i have tried,4
very clean and not crowded on weekends they do price match only with frys safeway albertson and basha,2
we definitely had fun and enjoyed the fan we will be back,3
we decide to have our christmas party here for the enterteiment i was so desagree the food the plates were expensive and not very good  also they did let us play on the table pools because the have some kind of activity with few people over,1
banh pho and bun are both awesome love this place,4
all of the dishes were fantastic when the new owner took over now the dishes have been of such poor quality that i would rather eat asian frozen food,0
it was a good lunch  i had by recommendation the carne asada quesadilla a taco and the chips and salsa  it was all good my favorite was the salsa  the space is your becoming more and more typical renovated home  the lunch line was short and it moved fast ill be sure to visit again soon,3
was really hoping that this place would be amazingnnit wasntnnntotally overratednncarne asada is very blandnn1 tacos from taco trucks in la blow this place awaynnclose bysuch a shame,1
ordered the carne asada breakfast burrito the most bland burrito i have eaten since the invention of the microwave i assume it was the carne asada burrito there was no evidence of meat to confirm this claim ill go back once more to try the quesadilla not going to hold my breath though,0
the beans are bland as cardboard the onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica i recommend taco bell over this place however the cochata was delicious maybe they should rethink their mission and vision,0
my rating is solely based on the service i ordered food to eatin but it took close to an hour to be prepared so i changed it to takeout havent tried the food yet,1
excellent service great margaritas and fantastic food the most authentic mexican in charlotte the pork and pineapple tacos are a must have my new favorite mexican restaurant in charlotte,4
food is great service sucks,1
its now 349 cleaners  they do a decent job but i finally realized theyre the ones stapling the return ticket to the garment itself  and i dont like little holes appearing on the fronts of my dress shirts,1
the food is really really good but the service is horrifically slow  if you are golfing or live in the community it is well worth the wait if you have a few days to spare,2
overrated brunch i shared 2 dishes the scotch eggs and the full monty which is a combination of all the options for breakfast it wasnt really tasty or that memorable,1
just a solid neighborhood pub good atmosphere good english tap list didnt eat anything impressive selection of scotch was full 2pm on mon,3
id heard a few recommendations to try the pizza here i was thoroughly disappointed the only reason i give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that they offer some options you dont find at every pizza place with that said i didnt really like the pizza,1
i have been to all the ahso sushi locations and this is by far the best one go to mr kim and ask for a mr kim 4 best susji ive ever had,4
a nice variety of asian plates are offered in this place not the best ones i have tried in all categories but if you want variety this is a good place,2
always friendly call ahead and theyve got it waiting  i wish they could just know by my  what i always order,3
delicious food  eloquent classy atmosphere and impeccable service its pricey but i dont mind paying for good food there are also happy hour specials if you sit at the bar before 7,4
worst customer service the guy really asked me for my receipt to check my bag because he assumed i was stealing and he felt like an idiot when he didnt find anything,0
the food is absolutely amazing had a cubana sandwich and fries with a coke was one of the best lunches i have ever had the waitresses were very nice too,4
herb hummus street tacos chopped salad wchicken  tabbouleh salad all deliciousnnif i had to make s suggestion it would be to spice up the fish in the tacos with a little more flavor but they were perfectly cooked flaky and moistnnthe hummus appetizer is a generous portion enough for 46 people,4
this is one of my favorite spots in all of phoenix but i have a big problem  the andys favorite tlt sandwich is so damn good i cant get to trying more things on the menu nngreat food great atmosphere  best in class,4
not sure about this place and its amazing reviews  the service was slow and food came out cold  we got a pizza and burger both came out super cold it took so long that we didnt even send it back because we were starving  might do a retry but nothing was so amazing that made me want to go back,1
good thai dishes make sure you understand the spicy levels,2
solid 3 star red curry tofunnnot 5 star not 4 starbut hey  they did great with the one classic dish i ordered,2
heeelllooooo chocolate chili milkshakenndulishus,4
food is never hot and the service is atrocious,0
i like the 5,3
service was terrible but food was delivered promptly it seems as if this business dont value their customers food was alright nothing special will not come back because of lack of friendliness,0
ordered a meal for pickup went 15 minutes later and after they rang me up realized they never made it,0
when i am looking for fast cheap good hawaiian eats in vegas i stop here  love the marination that they use on their meats  great malasadas too,3
this spot is legit great clothing friendly and knowledgable staff and convenient location,4
my husband  i both got great work by andrew black cant wait to get more such an amazing artist  thanks andrew,4
good food decent service but not amazing like texas roadhouse  the ribs are probably the best thing i have ever had here and they do give you amazing rolls before the meal  i would recommend giving this place a try,2
look fo coupons great bread good food,4
really like club 36 ill be staying here for every vegas trip unless i get compd a free stay somewhere else the accomodations were really comfortable and the staff was extremely hospitable,3
dont believe bad reviews this place is top notch and beats spending 150 per night on the strip get a free 2 night stay on the weekend by buying a package from ontario mills 149 and you get all your money back at the resort,4
alright at best staff wasnt very helpful and food took along time for no one to be there,2
10 minutes at our table with no acknowledgement from the wait staff  not even an ill be with you in a moment one of those experiences that will never be repeated  at least not at this place since we wont be back major fail on a basic of the business,0
small indian takeout spot in latta arcade with pretty good food although my veggie entree was a bit watery  the naan was fresh which is always important  ill probably go back and try something different just to make sure theyre legit,2
i would give this place an eek methinks not except for the fact that they have such great stuff but a no return policynone at all prevents me from ever going again,1
great everyman pub just beer and basic drinks but thats ok sociable atmosphere appeared to be mostly locals but i felt right at home 30something crowd give or take,3
my previous  review highlighted a lack of offers this has now been challenged with this bold printout slapped on their notice board see picture nnstill theres a lack of offers regarding drinks,2
solid burgers here perhaps not a pinnacle of medium rare glory but the taste is right and portions are filling id opt for the sweet chili sauce as an extra topping it combines with the default sauce in weird and interesting ways,3
this is a decentsize neighborhood pub with a good comfortable atmosphere  the staff when friends and i visited was friendly in general but extremely inattentive when it came to service,2
went in for a pretheatre dinner and had the haggis which was excellent staff were friendly and id certainly recommend cc blooms for the food,3
if you want to feel like youre staying in an office park even though its only blocks from the castlethen this is your place  the outside and rooms are lackluster you might even pass by it without noticing and your room is a basic rectangular room but the second floor bar and lounge is pretty classy,2
just popped in here as some of our friends who joined us after work hadnt eaten so for them pizza for us a glass of wine and beer,2
rooms small apart from one or two fantastic suites all a bit tired nownfull of american coach partiesnoh and they play highland music over breakfast  i think that says everything that needs to be said,1
tasty diner with plenty of comfort food the taps were dry when we visited but they have a small selection of bottled drinks to choose from the bangers and mash and shepherds pie were decent a great hangover meal restaurant,2
fab music and great drinks selection some people so cool it looked like it hurt but overall friendly and lively pain that the loos are all the way downstairs and not the best for 5 inch heels,3
ive been here for a couple of nights out and the cocktails are good and the music is cool a bit crowded and full of a lot of posers taking selfies but if you can handle that then its a good place to start your night,2
kitchin is an outstanding high end restaurant in leith with well prepared regional dishes such as grouse and local ingredients and cheeses and an excellent wine list,4
amazing food and the hospitality cannot be beat traveling alone can be tough and the staff here made me feel at home plus the owner was there also greeting diners love it try the pizza,4
although the place is quite nice the service was just awful when we had our drinks they gave us a very dirty glass who couldnt they notice we waited for almost 30 minutes to have our food and to be honest its too expensive for what you have im definitely not trying again,0
friendly staff and great upstairs good views of the high street they still dont get iced lattes quite right but thats seemingly true for most starbucks outside the states,3
aberdeen angus rare roast beef wild venison haggis brie de meaux chicken liver pate and fresh crunchy crusty bread  now thats what i call an absolutely perfect saturday afternoon meal oh if only i lived closer to this little bit of heaven,4
flawless really great service excellent food classic setting looking forward to next time and hoping there is one,4
great pub with friendly atmosphere and an excellent selection of food and drink great for a catch up with friends,3
food is quite nice and not overpriced recommend haggis and seafood the lunch set is great value,4
went in for food twice over the weekend first time ive been in since it had its 50s diner overhaulnnanyway the food is great not a huge selection but well worth the money they also do the best breakfast i think ive ever had superb fry up for only u00a3650  nom nom nom,4
the hampton is the nearest thing to a pub in this area of town nice bar area and very friendly staff had food once here but as a veggie there wasnt a huge amount to choose from on the menu   has a good reputation for food with local folk though,3
salsa verde cilantro pork crackling you cant ask for anything better surprisingly dioecious authentic mexican food excellent drink and food selection having grown up on mexican food this is certainly up to standard good ambiance too,4
conveniently located fine if you just want a quick drink and a sit they also do takeaway pastry mediocre looking pastry sandwiches and beveragesnnpeople were totally right about the coffee being too hot though jeebus that stuff was scalding my latte was out to torture tongues,2
went here for my birthday dinner food was beautiful staff were friendly and more than accommodating a very enjoyable dinner,3
the piemaker boasts that its sausage rolls maintain the old miners tradition of rolling the peppery sausage meat in two layers of pastry ndouble pastryntoo perfect,3
v good service with funny and friendly staff,4
apart from the manager lady who seemed like a massive control freak the food was really good i had the prawn cocktail and gnocchi both were delicious i just happened to be sitting in the worst part of the restaurant right at the back where i could hear all the conversation between staff,2
very friendly bar staff who were even willing to show the us open golf in between world cup games would return for sure,2
lovely evening outna good little spanish placenis a nice fresh meal,3
free entry so it cant hurt to go make sure you go downstairs its the scottish section its a nice lay out and some of the art is really interestinglike the one of doctors about cancer be warned thoughthere may be little kids putting crowns together on the floor when you go in,2
im starting to turn into a proper wanker who likes art galleries had the best time here today with me mammy there was an exhibition on about witches which was very cool and interesting and some other neat paintings too the spiced fruit scone in the cafe with cream and jam was totally epic too,4
middling italian fare on the grassmarket you could do much worse in the uk  think bella italia but you could also do better its a fine place to enjoy a slightly better than average italian meal on a sunny day,2
great food nachos are plain but the haggis is great,3
good for watching the football in  getting a bit of a flavour of the down to earth side of the west end clean  cheerful with pleasant service although not without pretension as stellas u00a3395 a pint,3
good price and great location only a few minutes walk from the shops and the theatre however the room was terribly cold because the windows arent double glazed saved money by staying there but ended up very cold at night,1
medieval walls stores all the prayers thoughts and hopes whispered over the centuries generations passed away and now we have short moment to calmly leave our thoughts and hopes in this timeless place stop and appreciate this great privilege which you have,4

city nothwestgatekierland commonstempe marketplaceboring depressing place unworthy of affection,0
well the rolls here are pretty special the jimmy the attorney and the omg roll are fantastic as is the price 1895 all you can eat the carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the food safe practices were questionable i will try it again in a few weeks,1
mediocre sports bar the place is clean and looks nice but honestly there is nothing that really sets it apart from any other place around townnnone issue i have is the lack of selections for someone that eats vegetarianvegan even some pretzel bites or hummus would be nice,2
happy hour from 11pm  3am for 1199 is legit the selection they put out during this time is limited but is still satisfying if you want a good cheap korean bbq fix,2
love this place good happy hour specials food is consistently great,3
almost five stars the sushi special not good its not fresh and very simple taste everything else delish,3
this place is not bankrupt anymore they are open for business although i dont know how or why the food is terrible and i mean really terrible the bar is ok but mostly the typical local bar huggers i didnt try any mixed drinks so i dont know if they can make a drink or not but they sure cant cook,0
the best farmers market ive been to in the phoenix area locally produced olive oil cheese eggs grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my saturdays show up at 11 for the cooking demo youll thank me,3
portions are large ribs are tender sauces are flavorful and prices are fair  im not sure what else you can ask for in a bbq joint,3
good food  bad service,2
i had the big slab take out it sucked this place has gone downhill fast ribs looked like dried jerky on a bone im not going back,0
ok so when its around 2 am and you just won a good amount of money on the nickle slots what do you do  you celebrate with some sbarro pizza thats what you do  i got one slice of pepperoni and mushroom and it hit the spot  ok when youre in a hurry and need something quick,2
i will spare you the details and just say that i have had three bad experiences in a row at outback steakhouse three different locations too i give up,0

we have been to la calabria a couple of times and the food has been excellent the butternut squash ravioli is fantastic service is a little overwhelming give me some time to read the menu please na little pricey for what you get made the mistake of having the house chianti we did not care for it,2
not very impressive  tables and floor dirty  i spilled accidentally and staff watched as i cleaned up with no offer of help   left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly,1
the location of this place is pretty unfortunate in the ghost town that is city north  and i might be spoiled by other yogurt shops but the variety seemed to be lacking  the saving grace would have to be the 12 price tuesday twitter word of the day,2
love this place  i have not had a single thing that i did not enjoy and the portions are big enough for sharing  leftovers are great the next day,3
one of the best bolba in town i hope they dont close lee lees seems to be in a bad situation right now but i hope if they close this place gets a new venue,4
i always get friendly customer service here and they have a lot of real fruit drinks here i think they are one of the best places for boba drinks,4
we waited two hours for our dinner  they did not care and even when we got our food it wasnt made to our taste the waiters were running around like they didnt know what they were doing i would never go there unless you want to starve,0
fun uberprofessional and generally awesome ive printed shirts for my kid custom baby shower onesies snarky sweatshirts you name it  the staff is great the owner has customer service down to a tee haaaa and the atmosphere is lively,4
we have stopped here for lunch many times and always had a good experience  the service is good and so is the food  i do find the price a little bit high for what you get,3
good place for lunchtime burritos good service and nice atmosphere,2
ambiance is a 5 quiet and away from the bustle of e carson st bdc occupies the ground floor of a renovated row house tables are scattered over many rooms and an inviting outdoor deck bdc serves inteligensia coffee like 21st street oatmeal and gelato are also menu highlights,3
barista cantwont reheat cold coffee i was told to pay for a refill if i wanted to finish my drink no thanks,1
this is one of the best coffee spots ever  the people are incredible and the food rocks  i am there at least once a week it is an fabulous place to meet with your friends,4
found out this place is closing and i am not very surprised  it seemed to lack a good atmosphere and the coffee was not that impressive  best of luck to the owners check out crossroads books and coffee to support a local shop in the burbs instead,1
we had brunch here and it was just ok  i had the florentine eggs benedict   it was tasty but the poached eggs were too well done yolk not runny enough  the hollandaise was not seasoned enough  bacon was burnt  split pea soup was interesting but ultimately not very satisfying,1
love this resort  its about as as nice a location as you can get in the phoenix metro area  visited the resort and had massages and manicures at the joya spa  wow what a great way to spend the afternoon  if you go make sure to spend some time at the pool area the views are amazing and so relaxing,3
so good and the staff is awesome i like the pizza and salad,4
everything about our dining experience was absolutely superb  outstanding service and some of the most delicious steak ever  the salad bar is incredible too  i highly recommend it,4
this isnt great food its simply a place you hit up when you are trashed and need to fill your belly with grub so you can sober up,2
service was good by michelle but was told we could not order ribs in the cafe whats so said they cooked it 4ft from our table for bennys smokin  plus they have in the same menu as in cafe makes no since,0
love it looks real divey from the outside and way small inside total tiki tradition salty but sweet bartendress cheap drinks guaranteed to get you wasted get a drink in a mug theyre worth it,4
cool setting for vegas locals that want a hideaway  watch out for the zombies2 is the limit,4
bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb  i would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally yucca yucca,2
popular place on a saturday night  we were able to get a seat at the bar and that worked out perfect  the bartenders were very friendly and the food was really good  the turkey burger was greatno complaints and the fries were tasty too,3
curt and abrupt management  turned away on mothers day because in fine print my gift certificate had expired  in my mind along with a good massage should come quality customer service  though i had frquented other locations i will never return and will relate this experience to my friends,0
besides the great drinks saffron jak pizza is now being served at sidebar the super greeky pizza is amazing,4
atmosphere pretty good  had the fish and chips good portion and fresh cod had an early lunch so i cant comment about the atmosphere during busy time give this place a try great location in downtown chandler,2
killer pizza  if you are from the east coast than it should be mandatory for you to eat here once a weeknnoutstanding garlic knots,4
the mojito was good but it took a long time to get service,1

my favorite thai restaurant ive had at least half the menu but always end up going back to the red curry its a better value for lunch and the soup that comes with the entree is really nice not included with dinner whenever im in pittsburgh nickys is must,4
our service here was so slow we thought wed never eat there was also confusion on the waiters part about our orders at least we sat somewhere away from the crowds,1
i was hungry after checking into circus circus  all you can eat pork ribs or prime rib option sounded good  after one plate of ribs i was full  the prime rib seemed okay  the server was barely there  i just wanted to call it a day at this place and finish my hunger with some gambling,1
i just love the mongolian beef i order it every time i get take out,3
great haircuts w neck shave miller high life on tap and cheap what more could you want,4
timmy is so skilled i always know i will leave his chair looking my best,4
as long as youre open minded and not easily offended definitely worth a stopnntheres a lot of educational and historical aspects that were interestingnnhighly recommended that you go in with an open mind and a lot of time,4
this location is not a nice as the saint denis location but the food is pretty much the same chocolate chocolate and more chocolate if you go you must try the chocolate port port and chocolate go so well together,2
called around and no one could beat this places offer quick service and phone looks like brand new will go again if i have too hope i dont have to they have my business going forward with my products thanks and keep it up,4
got my phone repaired here and was stoked with the price about a month later after the warranty expired i dropped my phone on my bed and the screen shattered tape sticking out all over just didnt look as professional as i thought,1
if youre in the area youve got to check this place out we had both breakfast  lunch here this weekend  were incredibly impressed with their food plus they deliver,3
if i could give 0 stars i would absolute worst sushi and calamari i have ever had the calamari was rubbery and tasted like they bought it frozen from costco i could have bought better sushi from smiths or vons service was great they understood my dissappointment sapporo was superb,0
the place was charming and we enjoyed the food particularly the brats and sweet potato fries but to call it a serious restaurant is a bit much since the fare is mostly pub food  our main objection is that the music is too loud and the sound system is terrible,2
we ended up only staying about 30 minutes or so  its pretty crowded on saturday nights  they have a pretty nice patio  seems like a fun place to hang out with a group of friends,2
the wings were okay the server was okay the tvs were okay the tea was okay nnits okay,2
overpriced and out of almost everything i ordered why didnt i just leave oh that is right i was too lazy to leave fremont face palm,1
i came here to get the new preztel bun cheeseburger it was decent although i probably wont be back for another,2
premium price for a standard sandwichnnwould have been an enjoyable visit had the deli guy been at least welcoming,1
do i really need to review a starbucks  i think everyone knows what they are getting when they go in  the baristas are super awesome at this location and are quick with the drinks  seating space is lacking but that is ok,3
i work in the same strip mall as this store so i come here often starbucks has excellent service the deli is fast and the sandwiches are truly deli good kj at the pharmacy is just about the coolest pharmacist ive met and ive never had any issues checking out with my groceries,4
the wings are pretty good at least on tuesdays on wing night lots of fried food everytime i go there i think that i will enjoy the food but when i taste the food i remember that most of it tastes really boring nnstick with the wings,2
the best quick teriyaki bowls that ive had in the area i always order ahead so i dont have t,4
at 10 per adult you cant really go wrong here we spent probably a little over 2 hrs at the museum and felt it was well worth the price of admission i enjoy american history and this was no exception,4
one of the best places for breakfast  my wife and i went here at least once a week  offers health options too,4
i had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet  staff nice ambiance fantastic easy parking prices comparable to downtown scottsdale  my drink was kinda week but i would return for sure,3

i had the best burger in this place its awesome the waiters there are so friendly elegant atmosphere great place and reasonable prices,4
every time ive been here ive had excellent servicennmy selection chicken and waffles and a sangria,4
reminded me exactly of cheesecake factory in the palazzo everything here is texassized menu portions drinks etc we had an awesome saturday afternoon lunchhangover killer on a bachelor party weekend prices were vegasesque so a little more than youd pay elsewhere,3
they just shoved us on to a tiny table in the corner  half the restaurant is open but they refuse to move us  we are too tired to leave so we deal with it,0
this place is now closed apparently they lost their liquor license and those of us who purchased a yelp deal for that place are stuck with a certificate we cannot use shame because i heard so many great things about the food rip antars,0
i had been going here for years and thought they actually cared about doing good work for me they once did but as time passed it got worse and worse unfortunately since they messed up my last bass project chipped my neck pocket and installed pickup off center etc i will not be going back there again,1
i actually end up spending more time here than i do at my actual apartment i travel to charlotte almost weekly for work and the staff at this hotel is amazing they are very personable and extremely accommodating this is nice to have since i am rarely home,3
i have never stayed at a hyatt place hotel before but i will make it a regular chain from now on on this same trip i stayed at the hyatt place in nashville and both hotels were what every hotel should be great customer service  clean room and a great overall experience,3
i went back to the rio to change and get a quick bite and this place looked safe run of the mill as it gets but the prices are a total joke its a burger and fries for 14 bucks if i pay 14 bucks for a burger and fries at a walk up joint it should at least be sufficiently kick ass not at all,1
food is made fresh its good quick and easy  only drawback is that you are essentially eating on the casino floor  but got to watch a hockey game while i ate,3
very minimal selection small seating area not many bikes either  mainly felt if you want coffee go to a real coffeehouse if you want bikes go to a bike house,0
i didnt  go for the great salad bar or even the best dinner rolls i have  ever had we went for the steakevery one of the optionsover 10 were fantastic the fact that you get to try as many and as much as youd like makes it great  no this isnt a buffet like it  sounds go hungry and leave happyperiod,4
food was great except for the desert  we shared the tres leches and didnt care for it  bacon wrapped filet and chicken were great sausage is awesome as well,3
we had so much fun   we tried everything and everything was so yummy  just when i had enough we found we had missed two different meats and we had to have a try  as full as a was they were tasty too,4
great food fun atmosphere and the service is excellent great for a special occasion just dont forget to come hungry,4
my boyfriend and i love this place great mojitos and be ready to eat great lighting lots of room,4
this is one of those places that you must try at least one time it is a fun experience and the meat its regularly pretty goodndo not come on a holiday they do not maintain the same level of service and food quality,2
sushi was delicious had a great time singing karaoke wayne and his wife are a true treat amongst the typical vegas service industry,4
this place had horrible service waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold never even got my check to leaveif there was a negative star option this place would have it,0
well worth the drive  this off the strip hotel is truly for locals but always welcomes out of towners  give this buffet a try you wont be disappointed excellent service and a variety of food  good to satisfy anyones palate,4
the highlight of our dinner was the beef ribs prime rib and gelato service was good but i couldnt reccomend this to family or friends visiting unless its comp,0
dont waste your time or money small buffet with few options low quality food and poor service   go to the suncoast or mcdonalds down the street,0
i would say with out a doubt this is the worst mexican food i have ever had my family went there and the food was cold and hard,0
reviewersnif you go to a chain restaurant in an airport and expect it to be exactly like the rest of the chain youve already lost the game,2
not so good i had the aligator and crawfish combo both were way over cooked and very tough the breading was too heavy and didnt have any flavor,0
yum  best fried catfish i have ever had  the staff is super friendly the food is great  the desert menu changes daily but if you have the chance to try the bread pudding go for it  the shrimp etouffe is a great buttery garlic wonderland in your mouth,3
this place was surprisingly authentic tasting for being in arizona the food came out quick and the service was good so i will definitely be recommending this place to anyone i know,4
bad service dont go here they dont treat their customers equally they choose who to give good service to,0
the bar food is good for what it is bar food i love the afternoon and late night specials  unfortunately the service if often suspect thats been consensus at the various location around the city that ive frequented,2
the perfect nonfast food place to have lunch on our drive home from vegas the gyro meat was yummy and not too salty i absolutely loved the tzatziki sauce which had chunks of cucumbers and pickles in it  the side of rice that came with it was also good,3
this review is for the mad greek primm nv statelinenfood is ok not great or craving to come back every table had a bottle of tapatio on it this should be a clear message they are not serious about greek food,1
my rating on this particular location will never change but i will say this corporate sent me a wonderful letter and gift card in the mail because of my yucky experience and that made me appreciate the company as a whole but you vegas girls need to get with it,0
ive never once been able to get a pretzel dog at the mccarran airport location unless i wanted was able to wait for them to cook up a batch were usually in a bit of a hurry when at an airport no nnnot once have they had pretzel dogs ready to buy when ive been there hoping others have had better luck,0
in the past i really enjoyed great steak even though its not a legit cheesesteak they usually tide me over however this particular location was terrible one of the worst sandwiches ive ever had wont be back ever,0
who the heck even wants to climb this disgustinglooking mountain it puts the beautiful arizona nature and scenery to shame,0
very disappointing waited for 1520 minutes for a table despite empty tables everywhere order was taken and 40 minutes later they brought out our food and both orders were wrong sad,0
great breakfast spot  i prefer the other location on ironwood as the acoustics kinda suck here and it gets noisy  but same good grub  portions are generous prices reasonable service friendly,3
love this place the gyros are delicious along with the honey fried bread and chicken caesar pita definitely happy to have this in my neighborhood,4
first time visit interior is plain and old but clean service is mediocre at best and it does take quite a while to get your food after ordering i had the catfish and shrimp basket with mac n cheese food was fresh and hot not bad overall but a little pricey for what you get doubt i will return,2
stopped if for supplies and found everything i was looking for so i vote yes to going back,3
3 12 starsnn it is a nice feeling knowing that you are eating healthy  however most of the food tasted okay not great  their homemade granola with fresh fruit and yogurt was very refreshingnnburger  soso  plain nothing specialnsonoran scramble  soso,2
i walked into this walmart and busted up laughing 2 minutes after i entered  ghetto fabulous all around  nnyea for covered parking boo for not having the best food selection,1
the dessert trio was nice i had the salted caramel cake tiramisu and key lime bar i sampled a bit of each and was pleasantly surprised although the tiramusu wasnt the best ive had it wasnt too bad enjoyed our time here,3
love this place lettuce wraps amazing egg rolls so good love the passion tea good service good food good times this location is not as busy as some of the others so its a great place on a friday night,4
i hate that i have to come here for my packages now this is the slowest post office aside from downtown,0
do not deal with the salesman orlando the other sales reps warned me about him he is a liar and his sales commission goes towards his wifes drug addiction we regret our decision to deal with that piece of shit,0
for it being a complete ghost town with no customers there the wait was absolutely horrendous the one star is for the car wash,0
me and my wife enjoyed it very muchwe got the groupon and it was worth itvery good food and nice atmosphere we will be back for sure,3
i come here for my redbull fix  they now sell 19oz redbulls  it helps me get through the rest of the day  love it  cant wait until they start making the 40oz redubll,3
its nice to have this place close to wynn palazzo and venetian to load up on those essentials like snacks water and sunscreennnanother plus  its clean and new,3
i am there at least twice a year and i go there everytime and the staff are really friendly thats what we need these keep it up,4
this walgreens has it all  everything you could possibly need from souvenirs to spirits great customer service with plenty of cashiers for check out,3
only thing missing is a pool also the track iirc is 18th miles so it takes a lot of laps to get any real jogging in other than that this place is great,3
great omlette and friendly servers,4
im glad i had a bogo coupon i will give this place another try if i have another coupon  08242013 update  i have yet to return,1
tryst lemme upgrade ya nnthe grand daddy of all clubs in xs nngot diamonds on your necknpatron in your cupngood lets partaynbecause nella quiere su rumba,4
this place is gorgeous they had decent music nice bartenders and plenty of seating i went for a private party so i didnt have to deal with it being cramped or meeting weird people the pool area is beautiful as far as ambiance this is my favorite lv club,4
huge club full of beautifullooking girls and the creepers who like to pray on them nngot here early around 11pm and was able to get in under 30 minutes  nna little on the pricey side  guys are 75 bucks and girls 35 on the saturday night we went,2
the club was really spacious you didnt feel like you were confined to two areas it was fun dancing on the water,3
decent venue well run drinks are about what youd expect overall you need to go when there is a good dj we had some second rate djs who arent local but arent good it was a fun time but the music needs to be much better to really enjoy it,2
one of the better and classier clubs in las vegasnheres the worst kickern8 for soda water from the gun basically carbonated tap  almost unforgivablencome on babe reallly  nsource i used to be a bartender,2
probably my favorite vegas club so far they get just as many big electronic artists as marquee but its less douchy more fun and cover is usually less its annoying that the headliner doesnt come on till after 130 but thats pretty typical in vegas,4
hmm i was disappointed it smelt of feet and the music wasnt great at all but maybe i went on a bad night blonde barmaid is super quick and efficient though never waited more than a minute for a drink,1
classy and beautiful with pretty girls pools and poles nnid recommend bottle service here for convenience,4
this place is awesome plus the dance floor is spacious and music is great local night is on sunday but get in line early because the line will be 1 hour or more my suggestion is to find promoter and get on guest list which will make your life easier,3
absolutely the worst club i have ever been too service was horrible and they must be desperate for funds because the club was way over capacity i love going out but i will not be returning here,0
i live in vegasni always have the most fun at this club its nice bc theres an inside and outside if i get tired of being in one ill go to the other nive seen skrillex and many others perform outside if you are in vegas thus club is a must,4
best place to club when in vegas went for a last minute getaway with my bf and michelle hooked us up no waiting in line and hooked us up with drinks i love hernnhit up my girl michelle for guestlists and tables she will take care of u promise 9087703570,4

came here with my mom for my yearly smoked meat sandwich visiting the parents from san francisco for the holidays altogether it did the job and satisfied my craving but ive had better smoked meat,1
its tough to find quality vegan food when you dont know the area came to vegas on business googled vegan las vegas and this came up as one of the choices  it was awesome  the family atmosphere the very friendly service and the best vegan sushi i have ever had,4
this place is awesome great for vegetarians huge selection staff was very friendly super fast and if you are not a vegetarian dont trip they got your back too they have hot meals too try the shitake mushroom roll its amazing,4
not impressed food was waaaaay too salty and bland save your calories and dough for the other great resturants in vegas,1
3 words   ill be back,3
totally disappointing especially after dinner at sw the night before nneverything was pretty average the short rib was one of the worst i have had nnservice was decent but would have liked to have enjoyed the food,1
expensive but worth every dollar steaks melt in your mouth and seasoning is personalized,4
i would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails price wise the menu is fairly steep service was great though,2
great location way overpriced paid 22 for a chopped salad at lunch time and i would say it was okay youre paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool,2
i bought a discount certificate from local dines and made the mistake of not looking at the hours  we went to have dinner and they do not serve dinner but close at 3pmnjust wanted everyone to be aware of this  we were disappointed but it was our mistake,2
best burger ive ever had from a fast food restaurant  wish theyd move to the east coast  the first time id had innout i was vacationing in san francisco so when i saw the sign in vegas i had to go  well worth it  wish wed gone there instead of fatburger,4
its one of the better meals that ive had in las vegas consistently its a great place for lunch in particular,2
the food was good  had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch  nnservice was a bit rushed and not overly friendly,2
the food is ok you wont find anything you will particularly remember fondly but it is a quick casual and relatively cheaper alternative to everything else at encore unlike the food the decor is actually very interesting and cook,2
delicious food has low calorie options which is nice deserts were amazing saved all those calories on dinner have had breakfast here twice and dinner once great every time,4
service was adequate coffee was better than average the line was short and the price was better than starbucks so was the coffee,2
this store carries most religious items available the staff is very friendly and patient i went to pick up the susan boyle cd for my mom and a large print bible,2
service was good pepper steak was terrible how do you make fried rice so bad,0
cheap decent workmanlike meals go in expecting a diner serving diner food and you will be satisfied the service is decent the food is decent and the price especially for its proximity to the strip is greatnndont let the 3 stars fool you it truly is aok,2
favorite breakfast place in montreal bacon was out of this world along with the hot chocolate service was genuine and prompt a very special place to take the family,4
on a bien manger  mais je m attender u00e0 plus peut u00eatre car on m en avez parler en bien c est bon le service et bien mais rien d extra  mais je recommande quand mu00eame,2
one of the slower starbucks i have ever been to lately  are they union employees  they managed to screw up my order too,1
thanks for a great brunch donna the veggie crepe and banana nut muffin were yumnnmy husband had the works crepe and he said it was really good,4
great place for breakfastbrunch  the works omelet was very good and the warm banana nut muffin with butter was awesome  natasha gave great recommendations and was a terrific waitress  send her to disney,3
had brunch here today and my breakfast food was as good as ever brady was our server and he was great always checking on us but never bothering our conversation good job brady,3
their food is awesome but i stopped eating here after i found a long black hair baked into my pizza i took a picture of it showed it to the manager my last visit there and he apologized by giving me a 3 off coupon i will never eat here again fatburger is a lot cleaner,0
food is pretty decent we had double boygers and pizza both was decent price is pretty ok too honestly though i prefer dominos pizza and in n outs hamburgers,2
we went for restaurant week and it was amazing gigantic portions great food and the server was so friendly and warm we would not normally go to the epicenter but for this place we will be back,4
as with any other radioshack i can never find what im looking for this places employees dont even know anything about electronics surprises theyre still open,1
great food and great wine awesome pasta the description matched exactly what i got when i asked the waiter to describe the wine i wanted to order he described it to a t what was just supposed to be a small appetizer and a drink turned into a meal very elegant very nice very good,2
absolutely fantastic  from the environment the staff and the food the gnocchi melt on your mouth as you can see by my plate i could have ate another dinner,4
wow ive been her many many times during the day and for late night meals jaime or on the receipt jlynne is the most miserable server ive had year to date unless youre one of her friends your an inconvenience to her i even asked her if she was having a bad day after she snapped at me,0
perfect  the best 200 i have ever spent on an aromatherapy massage done by a world class therapist named jodi  the decor is like being in a plush extravagant dream  i love you encore spa,4
loved it went here on a sunday am and took full advantage of the heated chairs whirlpool sauna rainshower and steam room before my treatment had the bacial and it was very nice smelled wonderful everywhere i would do this every year on race day,4
really wanted this to be goodvery dissatisfied  fish was dry food was in general not to the caliber i would have wanted from what they are representing  service was fair  good idea but for us a miss,0
it was fun but every plate was very very bland  i was visiting for a week and decided to try this place based on the reviews  absolutely not worth the price  the foie gras was the only thing worth anything in the place,1
sarah a and i came here during restaurant week and enjoyed a fantastic meal  we both got different dishes for each course which was nice because we could sample each others  i even got a succulent salad which was crunchy and refreshing  ill be back with alex c,4
worst place on the west side  bartenders dont know how to keep track of anything  charged me the same amount twice on separate debit cards  wont be returning,0
the food was okay but not great price is just like any other chinese restaurants in that area but the waitress there was rudenthe plates and tea cup are dirtynni really cannot find a good reason to eat there,0
it made me sick really sick nnit,0
worst place to eat go somewhere else they even charged me extra for my 10 year because he was taller than 5ft terrible service dirty and smelly never coming back again,0
food look like it was jst tossed on plate and plate looked like a kids mealnot to mention i waited an hour for an appetizer tht ddnt even come with plateshorrible service,0
this is without a doubt the best italian food you might find in arizona not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price,4
i have not had a single bad visit to this barbershop the staff has been always nice friendly and provides a good haircutnni usually get the triple play which is a cut shampoo and hot towel not a bad place to go if youre looking for a new barbershop,4
the wait is ridiculous and compared to the others in town this one stinks and would not honor the vip free sandwich card noone in the place looked happy customers were stating this is my last time here too sad sad cause they are usually good sahara store is worth the trip always good there,0
we went to edinburgh castle early on a sunday morning trying to beat the crowds and it definitely worked  the castle is very well preserved and a must see attraction while in edinburgh,3
nice little hole in the wall everything was great even chatted up the boss a bit very nice guy,4
you see this place in many airports but this one didnt have the freshest food  the cinnamon roll was drier but still delicious  i assume they bring everything in from somewhere else as it is too small looking to cook pastries  still i am coming back as i liked their coffee with rolls,2
terrible bad employee attitudes and lack of team work the poppyseed muffin was so hard it crumbled into crunchy pieces wasted money went to starbucks for lemon pound cake yummm,1
the cookies are pretty here i like to come here and make pretend i was in the mood for something else so i can act surprised because the sandwiches are so yummy,3
warningnnthe bundtinis are like pringles once you pop you cant stop,3
everything about this place seems to be a lesser version of a normal cpk the menu is abbreviated the pizza seems small and the taste is missing prices however remain to be the same or higher than other franchise locations avoid this place if you can,0
has the best nigiri that ive tasted get the salmon nigiri enjoy,4
love the beer the appetizers are good too  just a great place to hang out cant wait until it cools down and can hang in the patio,3
i give this location four stars for the most improved  having gone from a eatery who only employed rude young adults the customer service has greatly improved  the food has always been well prepared by a very professional kitchen staff and the price is reasonable for what you get,3
we wanted to try this place because we had a coupon we havent been here before it was a nice place the food was pretty good and the service was ok nnwe cant wait to come back again,3
maybe i just dont get it its a tall bright clean store its a fancy store but its not at all what i expected of a harvey nichols even though i was just in for a wander as the store carries very little in the way of things in my budget or size i was underwhelmed,1
bleh meh pff overpriced lowquality diner food think dennys quality with a 300 markup,0
stopped by here to pick up poke bowls we ordered the garlic ahi and the ahi limu poke bowls with rice was so delicious we bought a pound of the ahi limu to bring home to los angeles nnthe owners are down to earth and know how to mix up good poke,4
this is one of those places that is just convenient for me its soso the service is slow i kind of like their beans and the red enchilada sauce i would never go out of my way to eat here in fact im not sure why i eat here but i do sometimes dont judge me,1
maybe its just me but it seems like the staff at this location isnt all that friendly,1
first time eating at hungry howies and will certainly go back service was friendly pizza fresh and hot and we enjoyed trying the flavored crusts  ranch and asiago,3
great food and it wont put a hole in your wallet  i love the spicy beef vermicello soup and the rice crepes and the avocado shakes  i can eat here everyday,4
this place is the real deal  the pho here has really deep developed flavors  good sized portions  good prices,4
awesome huge slices of new york style pizza  perfect amound of sauce and cheese on a chewy  crisp crust  pizza came out hot and fresh  staff was happy and accommodating  bing bang for your buck,3
not the place it used to be  they seem to be getting cheap   no more roma tomatoes on the subs just that crunchy unripe crap like burger king  the folks behind the counter are spanishspeakers i guess thats why the tvs were on a mexican channel  but at least it had english subtitles,1
very consistent  this location always does well with service,3
supercute cozy vintage boutique  stumbled upon during first fridaynnlike walking into the closet of a retro queen butter toast has a little bit of everything can find something for yourself and pick up a a few gift pieces lot of care put into store layoutambiance very enjoyable to browse,2
amazing clothing and fantastic deals as a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when i need amazing wardrobe items the owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful,4
overpricednbad servicenthe most important thing is the food taste really bad,0
8 of us just finished eating here  service was very friendly prices were definitely reasonable and we all really enjoyed our meals nni would come back again for surennunfortunately i didnt snap any photos of our food but here are a few of the place,2
for the most part i like yogurtology  what i dont like is their somewhat tart sour taste of some of their frozen yogurts  i dont understand the manufacturing process so i dont know why this happens but it makes me wish they were a gelato place instead  sorry,2
i have ordered from sassy sals in the past and the order has been wrong  so hoping against hope we ordered again   guess what order wrong again  last time we order from them  their phone help leaves a lot to be desired,0
we were very disappointed had the ribs and pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and mac n cheese none of the the food had any flavor except for the potato salad that was the only thing we finished dont waste your time or money on this place,0
excellent food and service highly recommend nice people clean place i would definetly return,4
solid breakfast joint off the strip french toast is the best thing we tried but the breakfast burrito is good too nnthe service is outstanding and they do a good job in keeping the place clean other places had a wait of about 30min but this place had us wait a good 20 nnplenty of strip mall parking,2
this was our first time here  the service was fantastic and fast the food is delicious and filling we will be back soon,3
chicken fried steak and eggs rocks  service was excellent very attentive portions were big and prices were fair location was easily accessible with plenty of parking restaurant was clean and coffee delicious we loved it great weekend breakfast spot,4
good food good service sometimes theres a wait but ive never waited more than 25 minutes and its totally worth it,4
this place was delish  their biscuits  gravy are to die for  so was the country fried steak pancakes and french toast we had a feast and loved every bite  def coming back on my next vegas trip,4
nice wooden yet modern interior with candles staff and guests come with a pleasant grungy edge a whole page with veggie pasty and even one vegan option vegan pasty yes i stuck with a veggie option rosemary chicken good to not rock the boat too much maybe vegan next time its intriguing,3
one of my favorite restaurants i eat at cornish pasty at least once a month because the food is that good and the atmosphere is ago much fun everything on the menu is yummy but the reuben pasty is the best on the menu truly delish,4
so good perfect for comfort food just amazing food,4
we highly highly recommend this awesome place  we both had the chicken greek pastydelicious a very unique place to eat at cannot wait to go back to try something else on their menu try to go here,4
i come here alot and their foods are extraordinary the atmosphere is nice too be sure to order their lemonade it was squeesh fresh when we went there really good serving size too iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone,4
very good like a hot pocket on steroids,3
terrific vegan food and great beerwoohoo just wish it were bigger so i could sit down and enjoy the food and drink more quickly,3
good food  nice atmosphere,3
this place is so gross but has a good comedy show,1
this casino is really really sad and outdated however you must try to see the new exhibit bodies  its so great to have something like that in town  i really enjoyed the titanic exhibit as well though it was a bit too expensive  ni think that i saw bob dole in the casino woo,4
we stayed in the older part of the hotel and the experience was gross  peeling wallpaper in the room meets urine stains from a previous guest on the toilet which took 5 hours for the staff to address properly you knowlike cleaning it  disgusting  it may be inexpensive but it was also unsanitary,0
cant speak for the rooms but the casino remodel is very nice and provides a much needed improvement  i enjoyed gambling there for a couple of hours,3
new remodel did them goodnnrooms smelled of smoke even though it was nonsmoking  room 1789nnstaff were great though and the location is really good especially if you have a car  easy inout of the strip area,2
stayed here for a short weekend holiday  rooms were good size easy to get to and clean  i did not like having to leave my room for coffee no coffee makers in the room  it is located right across from the mgm grand which was the site for our concert so in that regard the location was great,1
the staffs was rude and management doesnt seem to care i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,0
the remodel is on point favorite hotel by far loved the staff and that free cookie was the bees knees i cant wait to stay again,3
the staff here are friendly and go out of their way to assist their customers  i had an awesome experience with a female security officer when i was there gambling she assisted my disabled friend and i up to our room and was extremely courteous,4
way too crowded for its small size have to wait 20 minutes for a drink while you are being suffocated by so many bodies the only escape is the small outdoor area where you are again crammed in the place looks nice but im not about waiting that long for drinks while sweaty bodies press up against me,1
this place has awesome burgers that are hand made when you order them they are pricey but you get what you pay for and they always have the days sports running on all their hdtvs which gives a nice vibe their outdoor seating area is covered and really nice too,4
terrible food  there was no background music playing in the restaurant once you sat down so you could hear peoples conversations from across the roomnnmidway through the meal a random woman from the street came up and asked us for moneynnno return for us ever,0
dualing pianier pianos need i say more not to busy early in the week but standing room only on weekends good drinks no food and the perfect place to go with a crowd get there early though or your crowd will be standing most of the night,3
this location rocks the staff both front and back of house know what they are doing  which is very refreshing these days just wish it wasnt overrun w so many loud kids thanks gilbert location for holding true to pita jungles standards,3
solid pita jungle all our food was fresh fast and good a little bit of a wait on a friday night but not bad staff was fast friendly and courteous will definitely be back,3
so the service was goodtiming acceptional since we were in no rush nnordered a venti iced coffee  a tall white mocha hotnnbut she didnt give us a straw for the iced coffee and we had driven off before we noticed  maybe she was a new barista because she seemed a bit nervous,1
greasy  wet  soagy  they were out of chicken so i got a mixed of what ever they had left,0
disappointed was recommended was expecting so much was a bit dirty waited ages to get served so long we nearly walked out looked like loads of managers no staff staff looked bored and poorly trained what a let down,1
early bird catches nnew location on the sw corner of dobson and chandler blvd only coffee shop i can find open at 4 am that is close had coffee here the last three mornings and the coffee ladies are friendly drivethru yes patio no inside atmosphere sterile but hey its open at 4 am,2
great service good pizza however the sweat tea needs help,3
phenomenal new york pizza one if the best pizzas i have ever had in my life very delicious the service was top notch here and very fast as well it is very affordable pricing along with a cozy setting  highly recommend this place,4
the best part of my experience at this over priced noisy average foods quality wing joint is that the service is so slow that i have time to write this review thank you for wasting as much of my time as possible,0
came here with the inlaw family for a group dinner on a wedding weekend food was quite tasty and servings were just plain obnoxiously large when i come back through ill make sure we make this a stop,3
first check in on 4sq every time you come penny beer every 5th trip its all about the naked grilled  wings i get mine hot not a fan of the breaded wings but naked with no breading are fantastic also say hi to eva behind the bar shes great at what she does,3
i still enjoy old chicago after all this time  great place with lunch specials good soups and always something fun on tap   it feels like a true pub and places that seem few and far between these days ps they still have the pizza thing down pat,3
tried the corn chowder and it was divine i especially loved the grated vermont white cheddar on top,4
adorable spot for lunch its totally a ladies lunching kind of spot it feels like a smaller version of arcadia farms great food and generous portions its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is lowkey the selections are great and the food is all super fresh,3
great place for lunch although the buffet selection is quite small every item is very good,3
i cant believe i paid over 13 for two milkshakes why would i do that its not that they were bad milkshakes they were fine but no milkshake is that good not in gilbert,1
as good as bbq getsnngreat atmosphere friendly service great beer selection and incredible food  i have lived in texas and all over the south and i never expected to find the best bbq in arizona  try it all you cant go wrong,4
good bbq the brisket was good but not great in my mind,2
best breakfast burritos  i had about given up on this because of the clueless and tasteless offerings from other restaurants  best coffeennsometimes they will lose track of your order but this is easily fixed and i will keep coming back,4
closest off the strip reasonably priced jewfood in the northwest side of the valley matzo ball soup and pastrami spell comfort food like the other reviewer writes this place is hit or miss on the service depending on when you come in great place to sit and read the paper when you are not in a hurry,2
the gyros are not bad here  and if the sweet grandma makes it for you theyre huge otherwise theyre a normal size which is still very filling  5 with a can of soda they have alot of different hummus flavors for purchase here too nnalso can everyone please stop calling them jairoes,3
im in sun city visiting my mom and apparently this is a favorite of she and her husband im absolutely stunned as they usually have decent taste thus place was truly terrible  the only redeeming quality was that it was relatively clean,0
small place tucked in the back of a shopping centernnthe people that work there are weird  the food is great,2
its a post office in a crappy ghetto location thats all,2
i got take out cuz i was too lazy to cook  nni orderednnwonton soup with pork  good and flavorfulnphad see ew  it was pretty goodnthai bbq pork  i did not like the flavornnnext time i am sticking with my usual phad thai bbq chicken satay,3
atmosphere b  no music so created a abort of akward silence at timesnnservice a  very attentive and helpfulnnfood deliciousnnprice b a bit high for portions but not a deal breaker,3
this sonic had good food for a sonic but service was very slownnbe advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and presumably ice cream,1
good food crowded hurried service  the bus boy would swoop in and grab stuff as he said you done,3
sushi is ok but rolls are small and service is really slow  i ordered 3 rolls it took 20 minutes to get the first one and they served them one at a time it wasnt crowded i was the only one at the sushi bar   go to ginbu 401 instead,1
it was just okay  weve been to numerous sushi restaurants in charlotte davidson  asheville and this was probably our least favorite out of all of them  it wasnt badjust very boring  we have another restaurantcom coupon from the ayrsley restaurant so maybe that will be better,1
after 10 pm they stop serving mashed potatoes service is usually slow the cooks dont really know how to cook properly not impressed at all if you want a sit down late night go to arizona charlies,0
tasty food and good size portions homemade presentation and flavor,3
aloha friday laulau plate with the butterfish was a real winnah customer service was down right island style,4
soooo delicious  we always get the mixed plate with chicken katsu and beef teriyaki  the kalbi short ribs are delicious as well  highly recommended,4
dont know why everyone likes this place ate here three times in hope i was wrong i was right this place is over rated their ahi poke was salty you cant have hawaiian food and mess up poke,0
had the orange chicken and garlic chicken and its ok ive had better  wouldnt go back,1
love there lo mein vegas and tempura roll so much flavor and really cheap compare to other places also the most i recommend is to try there chicken wings omg its so good u wont regret it if u love chines food and sushi this is the place u must try its worth every penny,4
not worth the time let alone the money given i live close by i was really routing for the place and even went twice second chance was just as disappointing as the first,1
i love the food here everything i have tried seemed fresh and delicious and tastes good cold the next day for lunch too my only complaint was the egg rolls i love egg rolls and they are not very good here so i wouldnt order them for sides if you like orange chicken you will not be dissapointed,3
warning my recommendation is to run not walk from frontier airlines to the nearest southwest airline counter  my family has lost over 200 in a classic bate and switch ponzi and shame on every employee for not standing up for what is right,0
no surprise here flight was delayed again and is finally left this morning at 1130am the next day original flight has been delayed for over 24 hours now ive been well at my final destination for at least 12 hours nownnnjust stop you suck frontier,0
i love this place because of the great food and i enjoy how they have a separate dining area from the bar the different styles of burgers are great we enjoyed watching a hockey game on the big screen in the dining room go on a monday when the burgers are 5 i personally wouldnt pay 811 for a burger,3
this is the best kabob place ive found on the east side we usually do take out and the meat is cooked and seasoned perfectly and the rice is delicious very gracious staff as well i usually order the beef kabob and i love it,4
beware place has become pretentious cover for women now and expensive drinks,0
im sorry but i feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio headache toonni must say im very impressed with how john the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way worth another try thanks,1
ok so this place is not favorable i do not want to incite any horror sensations but this place brought unwanted objects in my food and a terrible case of stomach problems for a few days skip this place if youer craving thai go elsewhere,0
great place for italian food very family friendly mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff never had a bad meal my favorite is sirloin marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge recommend to anyone who enjoys quality italian for a good price,4
i wouldnt eat here again if it was free  the food was just okay at best  but the minute you walk in your feet stick to the floor  the tables and counter tops are sticky  it is just filthy in this place  do not recommend this under any circumstances,0
catfish taco lunch special every friday  great lunch for 5nnthat said the best time of day to visit the kitchen is happy hour  bargains on very high quality offerings,4
went there on steak night didnt have a big selection of food steak cooked just the way u like itliked fried oysters and cheese cake ice cream i think it was 12,2
dont gonnthe lamest buffet ive ever participated innnif youre staying at the gold coast just walk accross the street to the palms buffetnnat least the food didnt hurt me belly for that i give it two stars,1
our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no chinese or italian food my huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs,1
i have been here 3 or 4 times and have always received great servicethe only reason why i come is for the zuppa  tuscana soup and breadsticks so i can not comment on the rest of the food they seem to have a lot of new items on the menu including some yummy looking desserts,2
super nice checkers peggy carmallee and connie store manager clean and very helpful meat and deli people,4
i love metta yoga  the instructors are so warm and helpful and the other students too are not afraid to laugh and also help me get a pose  awesome vibes to this place  i bought a package deal so i could come again after my first free class,4
cleanly place was satisfied with the bowl of pho i got,3
ive only ordered carryout pho from here and it was phenomenal the broth is a tad nontraditional but very flavorful and totally delicious,3
ok service bad food we had a group of 8 and no one liked their dishes,0
its harder to find because its located under the steps in the plaza  it looks dodgy but this is a legit place  service was good and its decent in pricing for the area,2
for arizona this place does a pretty good breakfast the french toast is where its at thoughso when you go youll want the french toast end of story,2
the staff is nice but the clothing is super overpriced 40 for a plain tshirt no thanks,1
saw 2 roaches my last visit i will not be back change the name to roaci,0
this place is decent if i got a craving for gyros stay away from the chicken gyro though that was not good at all nni dont think i would go back since i found one that was so much better in the galleria mall in henderson kyklos is so much bettter,1
i got a horrible haircutwill never go backi am not very picky and all i asked was for my stylist not to take much offshe cut almost 5 inchesunacceptable,0
its much too much in my opinion  long lines big crowds so much merchandise you cant digest it all,1
my 4 year old likes this place he was disappointed that they stopped giving out balloons the food is ok and they have a respectable beer and cocktail selection  as far as the food it is predictable and decent,2
just had dinner last night here  the pinot grigio just ok but the food was really good  i would receomend this resturant to anyone,3
i really liked the place went and got halfpriced pizza on a wednesday the waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks the pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price i paid im definitely going back,4
good buffet all you can eat style restaurant good variety of sea food and some sushi although i didnt eat any my brother said it was good good place to go for the price,2
very standard as far as buffets go with a good seafood selection sushi and respectable dishes keeping in mind that mesa is not the culinary center of united states i think everyone can put this on their list of okay places to eat,2
decided to go here again last night with the family not my choice didnt try the sushi or anything risky but was still up all night with 2 so was my mother nnhavent been in over a year and a half and def will never return,0
the food was ok when they have it i counted 8 empty pans the ice cream was the consistency of milk all this for 1249 i got ripped off,1
i dont know why i waited so long to try this place ive heard so much about it  i had the burnt ends bbq sandwich  twice baked potatoes  sioux city ginger beer nonalcoholic which was a great combination    if youre up for bbq sauce thats thick spicy  sweet this is the place for you,4
great bbq the chicken is the best bbq chicken ive ever hadncornbread is sick nalso try the pineapple tequila so great to sip with a meal nmy fav place in cu,4
try the chicken and fried beef this place is your traditional cuban joint and one of the few that is really good in this area be prepared to wait a little while but that is usually standard at most authentic cuban places you will not leave hungry  they have a live band on weekends,3
ask for kym  enough said,4

the food was decent at best  service was awful  lazy host slow service  mediocre food  i would not go back to this location  management needs to work on the customer service for this restaurant,1
not my favorite hilton but i appreciate that the hotel is on the far end of the strip with no casino made it seem more like a relaxing vacation the rooms were affordable in price but the spa is a different story were hilton fans and will visit this hotel again,2
i went here a couple of months ago because my cousin recommend this place i dont think i will be back here again i did get my eyebrows waxed here and the lady didnt do a good jobnnthe place is clean staff is friendly but they do try to upsell some of their products,0
love this location  i created naked sushi at geisha house a few years ago and  im glad to see they kept it going since i left  food is great and the staff are very nice,3
chef george was great and very personable dinner went well but were very disappointed that the didnt have all the desserts in the menu only the basic stuff even when i mentioned some of the drinks they didnt have either atmosphere is very nice and modern but i have had better for less price,2
its okay  the food isnt even remotely irish  they can do better,1
love this hotel very kid friendly breakfast was great and economical close to many restaurants and right off the freeway for easy access very clean and modern pool was clean and good size but towels very small,4
i love this resort and this bar is no exception  beautiful decor great service and excellent drink selections,3
design orgasm,4
the hotel is very nice and clean but there is not that much going on here also management is very disorganized took forever for my room to get ready and then they gave us a room that was not ready but at least i ended up getting my stay for 2 nights comped so cant complain about that,3
worst electric system ipod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off,0
its a beautiful place  get their crystal suite you wont be disappoint  beautiful room and view,4
if i could i would  give u  10 stars the worst gift shop stupid staff they dont know what they r doing they r good for nothing,0
this place does not live up to the hype i was staying for a convention the rooms were not that great the convention center was either to hot or cold my stomach is still recovering from the food a serious disappointment,0
i was at the pool its windy as hell something flew in my eye stung really bad still in my eye  i asked the life guard for help because i was in pain she just said youll be fine and brushed it off i asked for emt but she did not do anything  i was very upset  no help no service nothing,1
gotta be one of the nicest and fanciest rooms ive stayed in in a very long time  the bed was so comfortable i ended up hitting the snooze button multiple times just so i could rest longer not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing,4
perfect 10 every time,4
very disappointed in ariann 28 for any nonrefundable chargen overly engineered room there are about 30 buttons to control the room but i cannot find the only one that matters  the lampn the bed is too soft,1
checkin was horrible  worst i have ever seen in lv the managers and the check in people were unconcerned about 30 min to 1 hour check in  and even rude,0
this was my worst las vegas experience  the aria has to be the most overpriced worst customer service hotel in vegasnnbad overpriced food rude service lose use of reference staff  stay somewhere elseplease,0
loved this beautiful hotelnnice staffngreat locationnext to crystalif you love to shop ni will come back again,3
for the money spent and lost it simply didnt live up to my expectations,1
the buffet is fantastic,3
i absolutely love this hotel service rooms everything is exceptional nnlast there mid december i wont stay anywhere else,4
great place to sleep while on vacation soft pillows and beds the bathroom is modern and spacious with more than enough room for two people to be at the same time the food options you have at the aria are great but can be pricey depending on where you eat,4
amazing service  incredible rooms amenities facilities worth every penny highly recommend some not all of the onsite restaurants are pretty good too,4
this hotel was by far one of the prettiest for its cost the restaurants  bathrooms and rooms were killer clean rooms and yummy food best buffet by far,4
great room and even better in room dining staff check in line was a little long but everything else was easy thanks to the technology available tv check out from room valet was easy and quick service each morning i would stay again or recommend to others,3
im on the fence on whether i like aria or cosmo better but i know for sure that i like playing poker in aria so it is all the more convenient to stay there,3
i would love to stay at this beautiful hotel again,4
great hotel great service from the front desk have no complaints about the hotel nnthe only downside is the walk to casinos though not too bad if you want to go to aria nndefinitely worth the stay,3
stayed here in march asked for a upgrade to a fountain view the view at night was unreal although it was easy to get to the bellagio and the aria walking  to the cosmopolitan was a maze,4
this place is sweet complimentary valet non smoking need i say morennthe breakfast is and guest services is amazing me an my new fiance have no complaintsnthe rates are great even during big weekendsnnwill return,4
wownnthis hotel is great if you never want to leave the roombring bubble bath for the giantass bath tubtrust me nni loved every minute i spent here we never watched the tv the whole time we were there the even had amazing chocolate covered strawberries,3
this hotel is on the strip walking distance to everything but calm and quiet the rooms are gorgeous amazing bath tub with rose petals left on your towel the bar has an amazing view and delicious cocktails i cant wait to stay here again and enjoy some pool time,4
what a gem located in the middle of crazy we love las vegas and all the excitement that comes with it but its nice to step into serenity rooms are beautiful customer service was perfection at every turn the pool service drinks food and atmosphere can not be beat well be back every time were in town,4
loved to ambience great food average drinks,3
was craving some chinese fried rice and came out to find pretty good chinese food at this hole in the wall spot totally a great bang for your buck which is weird to say in vegas great family owned business will come back again,4
had a good experience i had the hot and sour soup an the mapo tofu they were great for the price just a bit to oily other than that it was ok good for the price,1
ive been to many all you can eat sushi places but this has to be the best one all the food was great quality and really delicious i loved the soft shelled crab and the oysters 22 is not bad for the quality and quantity you get great place overall,3
this place was amazing best ayce in town the customer service was very good and they had the cutest lil asian waitress working haha the sex bomb roll was delicious and so were every other roll we ordered  definitely coming back soon,4
overated not impressive in the least bit nothing special not fresh and the service was sub par wildflower is far superior,1
terrible service rude manager lost a customer for life and the manager didnt care,0
so ono wonderful fish wonderful service i cant believe i didnt find out about this place sooner im bummed theyre closed tomorrow,4
great food great service the best beer selection in all of steele creek,3
have only had 1 massage here  it was ok felt more like a sports massage with stretching involved than a relaxing one  i prefer the atmosphere and massage techniques at dolce  i do frequent this place for brow waxing even though they did burn me once  cute place though,2
just ordered the steak burrito i thought the meat was good but on the whole a very simple mealnothing special decent delivery time and decent prices makes this a decent place to order from,2
im a sushi eater and the sushi here is terrible everything has crab meat  even a basic salmon roll no asparagus or wasabi aioli etc teppan was decent no fancy show but not bad,1
wonderful ambience though a mediocre haircut definitely not worth the price 32 for a haircut they did a similar job to best cuts type place lady mostly used the trimmers which were a turn off had an appointment yet still waited 30 minutes kind of let me down,1
came in from out of town needing a shave got one of the best shaves ive ever had  the stylist was from out of town but she did a great job highly recommend this place,4
i put in an order for pick up my food was ready on time and my order was correct even with my modifications this is not a 5 star restaurant but it was 5 stars for what it is,4
love this place,4
fun place to take the puppy,3
we have family in louisiana so we know great cajun cooking  the food service and atmosphere were all excellent  the cost of a glass of house wine was 1300 and whoever heard of a martini glass too small to hold three olives for 1200  the bar prices need to get a reality check,2
service by casey not so good food was excellent,1
came here for happy hour the food was ok asked the bar tender about the free drink with any purchase offer on yelp he didnt even know about it and didnt give me an answer neither,2
laughable that anyone would rate this place 5 stars in the chicagoland area rosatis is right up there with pizza hut but they have the audacity to be twice the price a pizza from rosatis is only edible after 1215 blue moons i dont want to know what you people rated papa johns,0
good food good atmosphere terrible prices 3 burger for 6,3
i base my rating on the first and last impression of this venue parking plan for an hour to get in and at least an hour to get out we will never be back this venue should be embarrased venues double the size can get patrons in and out faster,0
terrible spring training facility bad food seats all the sun no cup holders many better stadiums around greater phoenix area employees are rude and make the experience uninviting,0
tried to eat here  despite sixteen open tables there was a twenty minute wait  when i asked the manager about this he was very rude so we left  we will not be back,0
this was by far the worst service ive had in awhile the place was empty and our server never came to us i think if they changed it to a serve yourself buffet it would be a much better place to have dinner,0
i ordered the cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious good customer service and clean,4
the food was great but the service was really slow and it was not busynlots a waitors walking around horseplaying nonly saw our waitress twice none to take our order and the other to take our money lolnnordered the lunch special pizza and saladnboth big portionsncould not finishnboth really good,2
i had my birthday dinner here it was my first time i was not disappointed i had the filet it was so good  i could cut the steak with a butter knife for desert i had the ultimate cheese cake  it was massive and delicious,3
amazing mac and cheese burgernndreadful pizzannthere were ants on the table,1
a vegas must if it is your first time romantic and inspiring the jets shoot so high into the air it is amazing nnthere is a bar inside the bellagio fontaine that has a great terrace to view from and if you are wanting to fine dine with a view of them it is picasso,3
love the opera renditions bring me to tearsnminus a star for faith hill and contemporary selectionsnnmy favorite thing in vegas,3
its a very romantic beautiful spot at night especially when the music is on took some vedios and still feel excited when replaying it at home,4
i dont know how many times ive been to vegas but my most recent trip there was the first time i actually watched the fountains of bellagio and loved it it just seems to put that smile on your face no matter how tired or hungover you may be,4
i love these fountains i can sit there and watch them for hoursthey are beautiful and even better they are free cant beat it for sure,4
saw this during the daynni didnt get to see this at night though nnsad nnit is beautiful nonetheless and it is where oceans eleven crew adjourned after their heist i will always remember that piece of information because i got my daughters name from the movie,3
such a beautiful attraction  i love taking photos in front of this fountain  best free show in vegasnntip there are a few restaurants you can dine at while watching the show this isnt free thoughlol,4
nothing says oceans 12 weve finally made it like watching the bellagio fountainsnnpro tip of the day pay the fare to go to the top of the paris tower to watch the show worth it,4
definitely do not miss this on a trip to vegas this is one of the most amazing things we were lucky enough to get to see on our short trip and its free,4
the best curry house in edinburgh bar none,4
nice staff informative during my delayed flight ordered the bratwurst good for airport food decent,3
love this place been to pretty much all the pho spots in the valley and this spot is authentic as for customer service i really enjoy having my order taken and not being bothered while i enjoy my dinner hot affordable delicious and the broth is aaaamaazzziiiinnngggg,4
i would say one of the best buffet in las vegas today the ambiance is nice and the food selection is very good its worth the wait and the 30 per person get there as early as you can as the line gets crazy long the servers are very friendly and efficient too,4
extremly dissapointed i came to this place thinking it was truly the best place in vegas but its not even close to good dont waist your money,0
went here for a last minute mothers day trip  nnthey were offering a special mothers day menu  not impressed,1
it was okay nothing crazy i mean all you can eat crab legs and oysters was my highlight,1
do not come here we waited 45 mins to get a seat no one is clearing tables the food is marginal at bedt i got a beef short rib the meat is so tough and grisly that my knife cannot cut through nstay way from herennok the buffet had some decent food but the wait for a clean table made this a no return,1
fast and friendly good food,3
have been coming here since they opened they have slowly cut back on lots of thingsbut now the buffett is not the same in the am it is served out of 57 warming plates in the coffee shop  smaller options for food but price did not go down will not be going back to the m,0
the buffet is well worth the price  my kids had a great time picking out which freshly scooped icecream they wanted after their meal and the choices were endless there  great staff too,3
i loved this place my bff4life made a good choice the room was beautiful nice view distance mountains the location was a bit off the strip which i didnt mind but it was banging the staff was lovely the guest were friendly and the alcohol ws freeeeee,3
kind of a long drive from the heart of town but the casino is nice and clean  you wont smell like smoke when you leave  decent machines and dining options  the spa is nice  i am a local so i have never stayed in their rooms  the lattes from baby cakes are super   great sports book too,4
donuts are really good if they have any when you get there  went in on a tuesday morning at 1030 and they only had a total of 10 donuts drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at dunkin donuts very disappointed,0
really nice 5 mile hike that was easy on the knees,4
excellent coffee drinks they also roast a variety of their own beans so when you buy those by the pound it makes for great coffee at home  we are hooked,4
food was finebuild your own but service was terrible we didnt get silverware thankfully we found chopsticks up at the grille no napkins at our booth and they really cheaped out with a single small serving of white rice for the two us 1299 each is just simply overpriced for poor service,0
after planet dailies and trader vics i was soooooo happy to land at p f changs  good food pretty good service resonable prices  only a few minor negatives but i much preferred p f changs,3
came with a group of 7 and had a fantastic server that got our orders right and got them out to us very fast nnlove the honey glazed chicken,2
ive eaten at pf changs a few times and it is always a c  i really didnt like any of the dishes i had this time and i think i have to remind myself that even when desperate and starving i should find somewhere else to go,1
who goes to vegas  goes to pf changs rofl well we were hungry staying at planet hollywood  had been up since 5am sooooo this is how we ended up here pf changs is always great no wait service was good  the food was delicious no complaints,3
this has to be some of the worst sushi and burgers i have had in a very long timennsushi was loaded with rice and not very flavorful  burger tasted like a frozen patty and again lacked character and flavor,0
such a great atmosphere friendly staff and a wide variety of sushinon sushi such a great surprise cant wait to go back again,4
i tried this place because it had good reviews on yelp big disappointment as soon as i walked in i thought to myself what the hell the decor in this place is nonexistent both my lunch order as well as my girlfriends was just as appealing as the decor in the place would definitely not come back here,0
good food   fair price  very friendly staffnquick service,3
pretty big menu and overall pretty decent breakfastnothing crazy good here though everything i have had is just ok egg works got them beat for sure or if you want some real solid breakfast go to the coffee cup,2
very pricey for what you get only ok service sometimes staff is a bit rude,0
this is the best east coast style chinese food i have found in the area and believe me i have tried several wonton soup is fantastic a large feeds 3 people theres 10 wonton in a large the sweet and sour pork is amazeballs my bf tried the beef lo mein he loved it mmmm cant wait to go back again,3
if you just imagine youre in mainland china this will feel right service is a bit strange  but its traditional chinese service i come for the ever elusive hard to find chichen chop suey and i love it,3
service  terrible food  soso blonde waitress with a massive black eye  classy,1
went for breakfast and everyone around us was sending back the food because it was not hot i had the lox and bagels which was good but it seemed not a lot of people enjoyed their food but good prices and decent food,2
macaroni and cheese with martinia great way to end a long day and the music in the bar area doesnt suck,4
they want you to sign a document charging a large amount of money if you dont cancel within 24 hours yet they make you wait and wait when youre there for your appointment im always ontimen ive owned two businesses and dont treat my customers that way im going somewhere else,0
great new location i am excited they moved closer to us always the best sandwiches in surprise,4
the only thing i really get here is the salad with grilled steak  its pretty big and like that you can get it with shredded lettuce  other than that everything else i have tried has not been as good as chipotles offerings,2
love cafe rio compare to the on on blue diamond which is the worst place ive been too i love going to the one near ann rd the service is fast even when busy the employees is helpful nice and they never seem to run out of the queso cheese dip my daughters favorite she dips her quesadilla in it,4
went to night had the spinach dip it was good but not really any spinach more like cheese dip also had the fish po boy good not great drinks were good its dog friendly which is always nice great ambiance nice for spring happy hour,3
the side cucumber pasta salad is tasty and refreshing but the sandwiches ive tried so far have been pretty bland  i love the sweet green tea from their dispensers though  its a nice atmosphere,2
we brought our bmw for a simple repair they gave it back to us undriveable and wouldnt help rectify the problems that they caused we finally took it to another shop and had to pay thousands to fix the problems that goodspeed caused go elsewhere,0
the wine here is amazing if you are not a wine person your choices are limited but you can still find some good beer im not a big bruschetta fan but get it with salami and pesto its to die for,4
this place has the best bruschettas we threw a bridal shower here and the staff was very helpful the food was great and so was where we were seated the live music is a nice touch but we were a little too close so it made it hard for us to hear each other  otherwise everything was great,3
the waiting is too long they should expand their patio  offer a complementary drink if you wait is more then an hour  who waits an hour to go out to eat this is the reason i dont come here she wanted to come here,1
you will find no other bruschetta place with such diverse menu and everchanging wine list which consistently exceeds expectations,4
went for lunch today for the first time hmmmm expected a little more than we got the service was great but the foodsoso both the sandwich and salad were a bit dry i asked for extra mayo but it never came and coke in a can for 250come on with those prices get a fountain i probably wont be back,1
great food crappy service and they tried to over charge us for 2 drinks wow i was shocked how our waitress kept walking passed us we had to ask 2 other people to help just to get place our order and get drinks,2
nice experience good price for me an hour is too long and 30 is too short  go for the 45,2
just got done having a nice dinner with friends great food and great service had the verde burrito great atmosphere and peoplewill definitely be going back,4
nice hotel situated close to old port rooms are comfortable and service is amazingnnice beds and the shower is pretty nice for a westin yo nnroom service is fast and amazing,4
the food is ok but what do you expect for a chain restaurant  the enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can,1
food is great if you like waiting for 45 minutes for it there were three of us and its not like we ordered anything complicated either the server did aplolgize several times and offered us free dessert which was also a waiting game as well i love the food there but thats about where it ends,1
i expected so much more the food here was eatable there wasnt much variety the sushi was rice and veggie rolls im not coming back,1
way better than i expected after reading the reviews maybe i was just hungry but the food actually tasted good the crab legs were precut the prime rib was decent quality and my favorite things were the clam chowder spicy tuna rolls and mashed potatoes,3
superb coffee shop very nice place great bakery goods excellent coffee and also always has reliable wifi,4
better than you average burger place and a real blast from the midwest  if you are in surprise you have a choice that is off the beaten path now  enjoynngood burgers good shakes fresh fries  yeah its good for a repeat visit,3
taste of the mid west no wonder the heartland is over weight lol,4
very bad experience mattress was stained bathroom door was peeling and front desk staff were rude when they were informed of the issues,0
this place is simply okay  its usually busy especially for breakfast on the weekends but i believe that is because there is a lack of options in town  nothing here is awful but its just not that good either  meh,1
brought in a flat that aaa had just repaired thought i might need a new setni was told im good for another 5000 miles they repaired the flat put the spare back underneath my suv and there was no chargenthey said it was there company policy everyone was very nice,3
tried the clubhouse burger  yuck  the flavors dont blend the bun tasted weird too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich long story short didnt like  gave it a thumbs down to manager who seemed un interested when i told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased,0
imortant if you are traveling from jfk on delta make sure you check your gate if you are at the c gate they will have to bus you to your gate get there early or you will miss your flight  great stewards free overhead bag  not too extensive food im digging them,2
first time delta out of phx and wasnt to bad f class as usual is overrated domestically and overpriced nnservice from fas was pretty decent and the newer planes are nice with great pe systemsnnnout of all domestic travel this definitely ranked pretty high although thats not saying much,3
love this place  they always have great beers on tap  the lil pig sandwich is plenty of food for lunch or dinner we take my dad here when he comes in from kc and he likes the bbq,4
my family loves their food my twin daughters want the chili anytimenbbq is great all the meats have explosive taste weve had family visit from mn and fland all went home with a few bottles of your saucesnand funbikers and suits and familiesanything goes,3
beef ribs were really good a little tougher than i like them but the flavor was awesome the onion rings were some of the best ive ever had i took off two stars because the mac and cheese was not creamy enough and the st louis ribs were tough and lacked a good smoke flavor,2
one of my absolute favorite places in vegas such a great piano bar and so completely underrated the bartenders have some of the best voices ive ever heard specifically dre amazing voice great entertainment and a must visit if you are in fremont st,4
high on price and low on friendly customer service food is good but over priced if paying for overpriced food at least be friendly to your customers,1
yummy sushi in a clean atmosphere i hope this place makes it because we need good sushi on the east side love their salad dressing too,2
i like this place the coffees are good and the food is tasty  probably the food isnt as good as the ambiance of the place it just a has a real cool vibe to it so who caresnnparking is usually a problem but the staff is very warm and friendly,3
i love lucis get their hot juan black bean burger its the best ive ever had also try their sweet tots to at least once in place of their tator tots so good yum,4
during the winter the pond become a skate rink  its free big nice beautiful bring your skates and have fun nngood place for families friendsnnif you dont have skates like me  its nice to walk around and watching people,4
dark knight porter was excellent  the irish red seemed off  we were there on a thursday afternoon  looks like they have bands play in the back on a regular basis  cant comment on the entertainment but the beer was oknthis is a tasting room for the brewery  no food 2 tvs and a few chairs,2
i love their blueberry muffins but today i ordered a large coffee with cream and sugar but i received  a medium  thats right my fellow yelper coffee drinkers   off to work i had to go before i really noticed i thought they changed cup sizes at first  tgif at least,2
what a waste of time twice the price of similar restaurants half the portion size and tastes average at best will never be back,0
our favorite sushi place  large creative sushi menu  complete dinners  attractive atmosphere w japanese art  artistically drawn menu ads on the walls  weve always had good service,3
great sushi great happy hour fast service even when busy ask for there white sesame salad dressing to dip your sushi in hooked love this place  only thing is it gets a little loud when its a little busy but its worth it for the 4pmclose happy hour its a great time to try new rolls huge menu,4
look  if you like sushi then you dont need a cool place to hang out  you want good sushi  look no further  this is the place to go  cheap rolls and just a basic sushi spot  this isnt the cool place to hang out or the spot to be seen  just good sushi,3
good overall quality a nice selection and they deliver to my office i tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order the egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles you can order via grubhub,3
the best happy hour mf from 1030am to 7 thats crazy 200 drafts specials everyday all sports on all the time food is the best,4
moira  updated their menu and took off those frozen potstickers that i mentioned in my earlier review  service was terrific and their new offerings were delicious  they have a roll topped with a coconut shrimp that is very tasty  also enjoyed the 5 bombers that were on special for halloween,3
gave this place one more try my car waited 10 min after wash before any attendants started rewetting it and drying it skeletal crew more expensive than other places so wont be coming back,1
they rip you off for oil changes also the guys are total salesmen i would go somewhere else,0
cant say much more that what has already been said good service great food well executed,3
bad service overpriced by vegas standards  i left in the middle of the pedicure  nuff said,0
the food was deliciousni too like a couple of others mentioned was a tad scared in that area but i think the food was worth the risk,4
went here with some coworkers for lunch was not impressed with the pizza at all the garlic bread tasted store bought will not return,0
worst ownermanager terrible receptionistndont ever buy a gift certificate difficult to use improper handling of appointments rude receptionist and owner,0
found this place after i moved to the southwest a few years ago when it was the only thing in the area years later even after new owners and a name change its still the only pizza ive needed good south jersey style red pies and they have a very good white with ricotta as well,4
its a very very good pizza been their 3 times  the only draw back is very dark in the parking lot,3
stopped by for lunch yesterday it was 699 and 159 for a drinknnstarted with a bowl of hot  sour soup next i hit up the hibachi station the i made a quick round the buffet station and filled up a plate everything was ok i wish they had a better sushi selection to choose from,2
we watched the restaurant impossible episode and decided how many chances do you have to go to a place thats been on a reality tv show  so off we wentnnthe food was actually amazing  im talking lick your plate clean amazing  too bad its so far away,3
i have never seen a cirque de soleil show before nor any show in vegas for that matter i really enjoyed it the musicians were topnotch the dancers were enegetic and exciting the acrobats were breathtaking we had a wonderful time of course our tickets were free so that makes it all that much better,3
only been here once but the sa cha tripe was very tasty very fast service and a funny offbeat location ill definitely be back,2
havent eaten here in over a decade but was hella impressed with the eggs benedict sandwhich wait was a little long,3
this location sucks everyone provided horrible customer service the manager was absolutely rude all i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold never again going to this locations,0
poor service,0
the sushi here is not bad but not great service is also up to par sushi rock pails in comparison however to nearby restaurants that have much better quality sushi and hover around the same price though i may come here again for korean food i will not be returning for sushi,2
not very good my friends and i were hungry and we mistakenly chose the first place we could find all five of us felt like our burgers were dry when we ordered medium and that the buns tasted borderline stale we all left unsatisfied,1
one word nasty take a walk to burger bar at mandalay shoppes better service and way better food,0
i had the cowboy the burger meat was nice and thick but a little dry so i asked for extra bbq the fries were some of the best ive had as well as as the chilli the cheese tasted like nacho cheese and that threw me off the service was great and they were always on top of our drinks and food,2
the service here is good our server jaimie was great and the yummy tropical iced tea was never empty i had the ahi steak salad which was cooked nicely but i recommend asking for the dressing on the side,2
this place is closed now waaaa so take your stingy butts to chipotle 3 stores down  they got 5 burritos but no free chips we will miss that,4
pink place outside ceasars lousy food lousy service  skip it  if you want inexpensive go to innout burger,0
the ordernfrozen hot chocolate what a rip offnnnyyyiipppeeenit was 110  it was coldn         that is the best thing i can saynnnbbbooon i thought starbucks was expensiven       frozen hot chocolate 8  mocha frappuccino 4nnnsummarynnothing specialn       go to mcdonalds  get an iced mocha 2,1
frrrrrrrrrrrrozen hot chocolate is averrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrage nnit rrrrrrrrrrreally leaves much to be desirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrred nnstood at the takeout window and serrrrrrrrrrrrrrvice was slow,2
frozen hot chocolate grilled cheese sandwiches goldfishes swimming in my tomato soup creamy mac and cheese and one of the best chili i have tried  cant you tell i like this place  my las vegas to go to place,4
if youre from new orleans or love new orleans food do not waste your time the breakfast was very disappointing  the service was slow and not friendly coffee is 4 a cup which they do not fill all the way and there are no free refills,0
the employees seem to hate their lives we waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us they need some vitamin d in their lives,0
40 minute wait for hotdog and burger others waited longer than us just for ice cream 10 tiny burger dont do it,0
frozen hot chocolate  thats pretty much itits worth the wait and worth trying it at least once no matter what the impact on your wallet is,2
the food here is mediocre i can probably make the same thing ive had here at home its also way over priced dont waste your money on an easy mac alfredo pasta or a las vegas steak strip hard rock bread sandwich,1
great brunch in vegas  sit out on the patio over the strip and people watch,3
love this place  of course they are famous for their frozen hot chocolate it is amazing the high heel pump sandwich was very good the food is good and a fun place to eat i have to go there a few times a year,4
worst service had reservations and was bring our child to celebrate her bday  had to walk out after an hour of waiting  manager was passive and didnt care  do not go here unless you have to do the touristy thing,0
awesome pizza but the service was horrible it took over 20 minutes to get a glass of water the couple next to us sat after we did but they got their water immediately we will not return,1
the service takes forever but they are nice obviously you must get the frozen hot chocolate get it girrrrrrrrrrl,2
just ok nothing worth the hype def not worth waiting in line youre probably there to just experience it and call it a day super cute inside and staff was friendly i will say i didnt try the sweets only breakfast food so maybe that was the issue,1
good stuff great food awesome atmosphere love the restaurant i will be back a must to if youre feeling up for dessert,4
its okay,2
the sushi here is very fresh and i always enjoy my meal i would recommend to anyone in the mood for high quality sushi prices can be a little high for specialty rolls,3
horrible i am from philly and have been in phoenix for a week now i have had some great meals in this town but this was not good at all soso service  yucky food nasty appetizer soggy salad  a tough steak to round it out avoid at all cost,0
the fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat  gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland  service was good if you dont count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away,1
excellent place  our waitress was the best,2
the guys at 412 are curating great merchandise from some of the top names in cutting edge old school street style that is perfect for young pittsburgers of all ages,4
long wait but once you get in it is an experience the food is great and the beer is as authentic as you can get out of the alps,3
their beer was decent but overall i feel like there are better breweries and beer destinations in the city i do enjoy stopping in occasionally for the atmosphere the german music great hall setup shotskis and lederhosen can make for a rowdy crowd at times,2
awesomely authentic german bier,4
my boyfriend is a brewer and im a restaurant manager bartender the only thing better than the beer was the service rob the bartender is great and everyone was so friendly giant pretzel with beer cheese is the perfect bar snack go here,4
dont go here to gamble the food is good but the bartenders are awful they spent the whole night gossiping in the corner and talking on the phone id rather take my money elsewhere,0
bons burgers salle sympa,3
people working there are so rude they chatting with coworker while i am waiting to check out they told me to wait and the cashiers so rude no smile anger faces make me feel uncomrtable,0
when you say your a vegetarian dont recomend the potato soup with bacon then dont mess around with me about the refund with no mea culpa,0
get rid of the fries on the sandwiches and put the toppings on that i ordered,1
their carryout specials are great the toppings are like extra toppings and the crust is crisp n chewy ive read some ppl ask fir extra sauce but i thought it was good enough unless u like saucy pizzas overall really good value n pizza were ready to pick up in 15mins nice guys that work there too,3
just genius fantastic desserts with a lot of great variety to make it different than any other place plus the fact its also a bar with some great specials like 20 bottomless wine thursdays you cant lose well prepared desserts and the best part i was able to order milkand soy milk too,4
i really enjoy watching the planes come in and out in this nice cafe spot food is decent and service is always prompt,3
stopped in sunday morning to check out  service was very slow and all food taste like it was cooked in the same bacon grease waited forever for our food and it was horrible first and last time for this place,0
i really like nicks it is good honest food at really good prices it is not as polished as some of the chains around surprise and that is precisely its appeal try one of the omelettes for breakfast they also have an extremely varied menu for lunchdinner,3
my wife and i come here every week get the same waitress vicki who is awesome and the same gyro omelet every time this is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time absolutely recommend ask for vicki she is wonderful,4
levi  was fast efficient and affordable  my car key went missing and levi came quick and kept his word when i had a problem he came to fix it asap thanks,4
your average chipotle i like the idea of chipotle but all the meat options are too spicy for me though to be fair im a wimp with spicy but its a great option for the slow carb diet the food is great if a bit spicy and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly,2
buy me chipotle and get chipotlaid nnjk my food was great tonight and i now have lunch for tomorrow chips and guacamole from here are my favorite,3
dont let the looks of the place deceive you  the meat shop carries the best grass fed and local cuts of meat  the butchers at this shop are super friendly and accommodating and will readily answer any questions you have  youll love all the meats here but you have to try the bacon  its like candy,4
went her yesterday nd got some english bangers and some english bacon  yummo they have a great aray of meat there will be going back there again to get some lamb next time  prices are very reasonable,4
disappointing  i drove way out of my way to come here and its was just whatever i have high standards for food and this was far below what i was hoping for i tried 5 diff things and after one bite i threw it out it wasnt bad just didnt put a smile on my face or interest me to come back,1
the food there was oknbut the place was dirty nthe service was ok but it was sooo dirty also with the waiters top and pants yuck,1
meh is right i actually liked the dated decor i did not like the dated staff nour order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table nmy mashed potatoes came out of a box was served cracked glassware i didnt enjoy my stay at ballys steakhouse and unlikely i will be back,1
the sushi is great here ask for the samurai special its great  the service was greatask for chris  overall its one of my favorite sushi spots in z next to barcelonas in scottsdale i have not tried the tappen grill yet but its next on the list,3
if you want horrible service and want to be treated like you are an inconvenience to the wait staff then bjs is for you this place just flat out sucks i wont be back ill use my federal reserve notes somewhere else,0
food was worth the money larger sizes menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an am pm vs having 10 pages of food chooses the interior was well thought out w wide range of art we had 4 different burgers all were great love the different french fry options,3
food is cold over rated not fresh and service isnt friendly waiters are always rushing you to order this bjs on this side of town is awful please get better management,1
server couldve been more attentive  sat in dining area instead of bar  my steak too done,1
typical food nothing fancy no frills but nothing bland or horrible either if youre just looking for a place to eat this will do,1
sloooow service basically they seat you and forget about you i watched it happen to everyone who came in food wasnt very good either,0
this is the best 24 hf i have been to in az very clean great equipment and plenty of space the volume of lockers with free locks is great this gym can get crowded when the afternoon  evening crowd arrives 5pm  7pm,4
this place is next to my work so its convenient the staff is friendly and always willing to help definitely recommend this place,4
loving hut is ok   great that they care  their heart is in the right place  food is average  frequently processed and oversalted  nice atmosphere,1
this is my morning place a quick drive from my house and conveniently located on tatum the lines here move quickly coffee is great staff are friendly whats not to love its what youd expect from a starbucks but what few actually deliver,4
tried archies cafe for the first time the service was great and the food was the best tai food ive had so far i ordered the pad tai 6 on the spicey scale and it could have been a little hotter it is a great atmosphere and overall a great restaurant,3
came here for dinner geez no one bothered to greet us seat us or act like we existed waited long enough  finally gave up  left  take your business  eat where they welcome customers these people could care less,0
hands down the best thai restarunt in las vegas definitely worth checking out if u love thai food the portion sizes are good great location with great prices customer services is good it can be better but i dont mind it because the food is execellente,3
great meal tom yum soup hits the spot on a cool day nlast couple trips here it seems the soup and entrees come out very close to each other i would prefer to eat the soup before the entree arrives nbut a solid meal everytime,3
the beef terriyaki was terrible it tasted like the meat had been frozen for months the price was expensive too we also ordered a couple of rolls they tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size i do not recommend this restaurant,0
when i first saw their hours of operation i thought it was a mistake and they meant to write pm instead of am but now that i have eaten there twice it makes more sense when nothing else is open and youre wasted im sure this place rocks,1
had the patty melt and zucchini  nothing special  was really excited after seeing reviews zucchini is frozen  same stuff you get at burger king nothing special about the burgers either very disappointed 17 for a burger zucchini and a soda,1
this restaurant is out of business i was really disappointed,0
good atmosphere tasty food this is a fun place to grab a bite to eat and watch a game or two decent drink specials  they do a wednesday night beer roulette,2
ive always loved walmart for the cheap prices and convenience  walmart yay,3
i have to say i was quite disappointed with the crepes  we got the queen city and mascarpone and berries they were thick and more like burrito texture than actually crepes  dont think i will  be coming here again for crepes,2
food just ok for me i had a savory crepe with ham  cheese wasnt great id like to go back  try a dessert crepe next time dim lighting cool calm  classy interior great place for a date,1
yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later really bad food poisoning that lasted several hoursnni usually dont write reviews but i think this is something people should know,0
rookie place if you dont care about decor go to us egg around the corner better service food and coffee bacon took 25 mins to cook bad pancakes and serve cold coffee by a very annoying waitress,1
went for a group dinner meatballs were amazing the other food was kinda egh also a bit pricey decor was nice probably go there again if it was for a date,2
best general tsos chicken in the valley higher priced but you get what you pay for love the option to get all white meat and brown rice,4
very good indian food quick service great price i eat mostly the vegetarian dishes from there but have heard that the meat ones are just as good,4
wow even after the good reviews here i was still surprised at how great food was i had the edamame soup pommes frites and steamed pork bun with a glass of 06 nebbiolo and it was complete bliss ill be coming back when im in town,4
im not sure if its a new company standard or just this location but im never retuningnrude service food was wrong quantity dropped quality goneni know it sounds ghetto but this place was my favorite place for steak no longer,0
went down there for compost and came home with compost and delicious delicious bread  i cant wait to go back again,4
12 for huge sacks of mulch or 50 to fill the bed of our truck,4
coffee tasted like dirt didnt bring out the whole order when cooked then gave half of my order away by the time i received the rest of my order the first half was cold and they forgot my toast the food was meh,0
went last night with a group of friends and the bouncers were aholes with us this isnt new york and you are not a high end club have some respect for your patrons if they want to buy a bottle dont make them wait for 30 minutes while you let everyone and their mother in,0
the best tacos in the city amazing veggies and indescribably great salsas the tacos are like tapas so you need to order two or three but they are reasonably priced nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order,4
the kale salad is the bomb,3
very friendly service and nice atmosphere they also allowed me to order the kids bean  cheese burrito which was only 4 and very large it was also very good hopefully i will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu,3
havent had a bad thing on the menu yet  and surprisingly authentic  must try for the phoenix area  im a regular,4
went in for weekday lunch servers sitting around bullshitting hostess seemed mad that we showed up and interrupted their fun despite an abundance of tables and unoccupied workers we were told there was a half hour wait time wont bother giving them a second chance,0
i very rarely give a bad review but i hate being ignored i tip a lot nnbig mistake hugennah well im off to find another place to spend my,1
after visiting a few thai restaurants in larger cities i am pleased at how many things this place gets right   food is great,3
pretty easy trail but you have to pay a vehicle fee to get in  the view isnt as great as some of the other peaks closer to phoenix but its nice to avoid the crowds once in a while,3
we live walking distance and frequent the store we have purchased all sorts of groceries and steaks and have always been delighted by the superior quality of food as far as their coffee cant go wrong when its 75 for a refill  definitely love this place,4
food was delicious portions were great and price was very reasonable highly recommend,3
we ordered to go shrimp good salad greatmeat in orange beef was disgusting beef skewers disgusting im not really sure it was beef not trying to be gross but i have to be honest they are not using quality products never again,0
another one of my favorite brands whenever im in vegas i have to stop by this store always have some good sales on some nice clothes nnben sherman is dope,4
huge portions good pricing friendly service  i really like this place  no seating inside but on a sunny day great to pick up and sit in park next door,3
i think this is closed their website is suspended,0
service isnt greatnnbeer is good and coldnnfood is terrible and my stomach has been turning flips since i dined here for lunch today nnwe will not be retuning to toby keiths,0
thought it was really good  had the chicken pita and everything was fresh and flavorful  the warm pita was really good and the chicken was well seasoned enjoyed eating on the patio would recommend it for lunch or casual dinner,3
coming from new york city to pittsburgh for college i always need to find good chinese food around the neighborhood my friend introduce me to this place and i have to say that the bakeries here are equally as tasty as bakeries in new york such as taipan or fei da,4
the concept is great and the raw foods are very good  but it all falls down with the service  ive experienced long waits here,1
lhamburger steak est ok  mais trop chu00e8re il commence u00e0 450 mais peut monter facilement u00e0 une dizaine de dollars avec les extras le take out peut prendre facilement une quinzaine de minutes pour un hamburger trop de boucane u00e0 l intu00e9rieur aussi lorsque il est en pleine production,1
its just your typical starbucks nothing special to report here,1
everything i have eaten has been delicious and reasonably priced my favorite is the blueberry danish the chef and the ladies upfront are very friendly,4
great pork belly tacossmall plates nice to try many itemshas good energy buzzingdefinitley will be returning next time in charlotte,3
the drinks are awesome while the food is pretty good it adds up since they are small plates dont go there hungry but more so to enjoy drinks and an appetizer always prepare for an hr wait,2
these guys have the right attitude when it comes to product and service  they are consistently top notch  their people are well trained and always very friendly  dutch bros is easy to give a 5 star rating for their great coffee and even better service,4
this makes some pretty decent tacos its very similar to filabertos and del taco but a little cleaner they have the normal things like carnitas chicken and shredded beef i always see the drivethru packed during the week which means the locals in the red mountain and las sendas area,2
hurray for happy hour 98 south has an awesome happy hour and you should totally gonnget a dirty martini red red wine and half price appetizers usually on monday nights they have an awesome couple playing jazz theyre really cool mannncheers,3
still a star nails fan and receiving the same good service  some of the nail technicians are more experienced and perform better work overall good value for the price,3
i want to love this place but i just dontneverytime i eat here i wish i were eating at olive gardennfor a chain i just dont have any memorable items that id come back for as opposed to olive gardens crack like breadsticksnnmeh,1
check out my review and photosnnhttpfoodtalesandotherfuntumblrcompost29865866478,3
no no noni was expecting far better while the service was better than the meal i must say all i was was disappointed tinocos has become similar to a diner with better than the average diners pasta,1
terrible experience  food service everything,0
a nice newly renovated hotel and a super cheap rate  i live all the hilton products but the garden inns are the best,3
this place has a nice small bar feel but still delivers all the amenities i frequent tailgaters during ufc events but i also enjoy non event days as wellthe food is above average for bar food and the staff is great i recommend this place and you get what you pay for,3
great breakfasts veerrry attentive staff and dogfriendly  what else can i saynnoh yeah wonderful patio with outdoor bar and quaint frenchinspired bathrooms waterclosets,4
i finally was able to get hot food here for this alone i am happy oh the hummus is excellent and so are the drinks,3
ive been here twice for brunch and really enjoyed it the veggie island breakfast was delicious good coffee and prompt friendly service,3
well we tried to come backwent back this am for brunch 815am not open  so disappointed signs posted say open,0
love coming here food is always good no complaints here at alland so awesome that all this worth the drive  thank you guys,4
i really like this place for their fresh sides their mac and cheese is really good the fried okra is served up fresh my wife goes for the veggie plate i like the bbq chicken very tender i also like the brisket not many places in nc you can get that medium price but worth it,3
awesome selection of vintage clothes for men and women  many sizes many colors so cute and the staff actually wears the clothing d great time nncheck it while youre in las vegas,4
beautifully designed building with high end shops  unless you have a lot of money you will be doing the tourist walk through like everyone else  i hope that they will have enough customers to stay in business  i personally did not see one person with a shopping bagand thats not a good sign,2
i really like this placennanywhere that serves fresh juices and great big bowls of soup is always great satisfaction and hits the spot every time nna great place to stop by for lunch with friends or just a quick juice,4
a amazing stuff i love the feel of the place the service is casual but professional and the food is next level outstanding when it is on the ever changing menu give the lamb osso bucco a try  it is fantastic prices are reasonable to boot,4
one would think when there are only two other groups in the place they would get the order right but once again another place who seems to be lost in the service department and the food was just ok,1
food and wine were excellent as always will return again very soon the veal was fantastic,4
i like this place alot they have very good prosciutto di parma it is very expensive but worth it  i also tried their lunch menu  i got the italian beef sandwich which was really good the only complaint is after a while the bread makes your jaw tired overall i will try it again,3
i finally found a good italian deli here in las vegas  my only complaint is the bread on my capicola sandwich was a little tough,3
calm down people nnits pricey and pretty average go somewhere else if you can but go if you have to because itll hit the spot if you want it enough  firstworldproblems,2
i will not be coming back here again horrible service my table was being watched by the manager and it was awkward i felt so freaked out i was scared to order anything not vapor friendly either dont eat here,0
i have been here before and always enjoyed the coffee  today went with some friends and we all made a comment about the bad attitude of the staff  the girl at the register was rude  i do not think i will be going back anytime soon,1
pretty good for kids average to below average for adults  friendly staff good price  not the best tasting but you can tolerate a slice or 2  limited dessert and salad options,2
paid top dollar to play in the morning the greens are garbage punched  slow  poor shape why pay to dollar for poor conditions,1
no comment,0
food a disgracenbakery cloyingly sweetnservice terriblenit all change when underground left nwill never go back,0
thank you darla for a relaxing massage the location was easy to find also schedule the appointment was easy,3
chicken cobb poolsidensprouts avocado so goodnsix dollar cokes  bargain,3
great for saints and lsu games,2
came here for brunch before a cardinals game food was good and drinks very generous love that they have the bus to the games very nice that everyone could enjoy their time and nobody had to worry about driving,2
tater tots and cheese with pretzel are great but since the management change and name changes wow has the quality gone downhill live in the neighborhood and all this is good for now is a beer and watching football the food and service just is so disappointing,1
ok so i came back here the other day for nostalgia more than anything and i realised that the seats are more of a novelty than anything else dont get my wrong i love baguette express but its always so busy and you must save about 15 minutes for queuing particularly in this branch,3
fantastic wraps and pizza that we all shared nawesome beer selectionngreat service i would defiantly come back soon,3
we enjoyed our meal our service was excellent and most important to us our kids had a great time as well the management was awesome when needed really have nothing but great things to say about dining in this establishment,4
yummy fresh alternative  tasty  the sweet potaton fries are worth the addon,3
walked to yogurtland  we saw the long line waiting in front of this ice cream parlor and curiously we decided to try it very distinctive and particular tastes we tried the chocolate chip and it was really good certainly not the gelato we are used to the italians but definitely worth a taste,3
my wife and i are regulars here  good because of the cost and availability of the produce  freshness also good,4
checked in and 2 hours later checked out  there was no working wifi service in my room nobody answering the switchboard no replies from management nobody available to help me out its a shame when management is so poor that a guest leaves feeling this way,0
horrible customer service malissa the manager would rather have a 2min  conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest,0
these guys are great  they texted me pictures of my animal while i was away  i would hands down hire them again and recommend them to anyone charges are reasonable and they provide very good customer service too,4
wasnt blown away by this place however decent selection of wine and various grocery a bit pricey but managed to find some goodies they have prepared food as well that sure smelled good i may come back,2
great staff even long lasting tan,4
a family favorite my family of four have been to the daisy several times it has become the go to stop that we all love we feel right at home and get good food and service,4
favorite uptown pizzeria be sure to get a meat and cheese plate  it will cement the experience,4
id go back  enough good unique food to go back  the 5 star item was the dessert donuts,3
love this place  reasons to give them a try  friendly service precision manicure and pedicure great prices  ive been here numerous times since and have been equally satisfied after each visit,4
how on earth is this show still on  i went two years ago with friends it was terrible  why oh why do people pay for thisnnyou will get far better value for your money by placing it all on black,0
my husband and i enjoyed the dance performance and the singing  there were a lot of boobs and im glad to see 90 of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts  it was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid 80 for two people,3
the food here is delicious flavorful and colorful this nice indian buffet on the corner of valley view and sahara costs 1100 and its worth it the restaurant has a nice elegant setting as well,4
snagged an online deal for this place after i heard about it from friends it was really great the portions were generous the prices were reasonable and the staff was very kind they dont have a full bar here though so plan accordingly,3
food was no good there were lots of indian customers inside is it a sign of good indian food for our taste not good at all couldnt even find a spicy dish find another place in lv,2
this market means well but its small and quite a hassle to get to it mostly only has a few cheese and butcher shops and many many flower shops i enjoyed my stop at the choclatier here,2
very hard to get help or information most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you does not know where or if they have a product or not asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for veterans day,1
nice place to talk and hang but service is poor food is overpriced wine is mediocre and we generally felt unwelcome hipsters would like it probably,1
very small portion relative to the price nthe food is salty dry and taste alikeni am a real international traveler,0
cute place but food was meh portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people as in not as spicy and seasoned the beef salad was awesome but id shy away from the pad thai and friend rice,2
my friends were in town and wanted to eat thai food its was almost midnight so i dont know what was open we decided to drive through chinatown to see what we could find ended up here at krung siam good authentic thai food good service full bar and theyre open till 6 am,3
its good for late night thai food portions not as big as most restaurants and a little higher priced  good  because its open late night not bad waitresses are  friendly has a nice bar,2
worst food terrible service and was forced to listen to the worst music ever created by a live singer hired to torture our earsni could not wait to get out of herennif there were negative stars for this reviewnit would be warranted,0
overpriced sandwichesnwheres the meatnordered a mediterranean chicken flatbread sandwich i couldnt even find the chicken there was so much cabbage in it,0
i dont remember what roll i ordered bit it was a big pile of who knows what it wouldnt have been so bad if it wasnt drenched with some sort of sauce that was over the top nwe came in kind of late but still enough time to eat but i felt like we were rushed by the staff,1
terrible customer service lazy staff dont waste your time going here 90th and shea store is a little more helpful but staff isnt very knowledgeable on their product line youre probably better off shopping online and doing it all on your own in store pick up is at least convenient,0
my gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever i left before finishing the 90 minutes i probably feel better massaging myself so very disappointed,0
simply the best ramen in scotland chasu ramen all the way,4
this place is greatonly thing was we couldnt get a table in the outside patio it was a friday night thoughstill had a great time get there early on weekends to get a good seat great local and nonlocal spot excellent beer choices dont plan on eating,2
i signed up on yelp just to post about lunchbreak even though their coffee and breakfast burrito are my favorite i have never had an untasty meal from these guys definitely cant go wrong with the buffalo chicken wrap italian meatball sub or chef salad very prompt deliveries,3
the food is bad if you are from la and nyc then please dont eat her nobu prices but tasteless dishes there only secret is truffle not used properly nnit is gorgeous inside and the service is great but if you are going to spend 300 on food and saki you shouldnt leave hungry and disappointed,0
went for my bday and the service was excellent but the food is another story the food is not worth what u pay bill came out to 250 for two had a ribeye pork bone marrow and two glasses of wine save your money go to bobby flays for a better steak and price,1
had dinner here for business and its a very nice restaurant ny strip was cooked perfect and was very good creamed spinach side was also very good mashed potatoes were average ny style cheesecake was awesome service was over the top prices are high but i wasnt paying,3
mediocre steakhouse  nothing was knock my sock off delicious everything was kind of average nnsommelier was spot onnnso many better options to choose from based on pure food in lv nna reminder to self  to not to go back,2
crap bad food overpriced and the worst service didnt know such a mediocre restaurant could even exist at a 5 star property on the strip ugh,1
great food at a great price came here for happy hour and their drinks are amazing,3
the food was outstanding as were the drinks the decor is simple but cool service was top notch worth the price tag,4
what a great experience  food and service were wonderful  the steak tartare  yum and the tasting menu is a real value in my opinion  youd be hard pressed to eat this well at this price point anywhere we cant wait to come back and beef belly  what bliss for my belly,4
yummy bone marrow and oysters nice classy place and great service,3
the chilean sea bass was amazing the atmosphere was great and so was the service,4
absolutely enjoyed the dinner i had here   service was excellent and i have some very good memories from the dinner here  a true pleasure and enjoyable experience  highly recommended,4
dont seat on the bar very bad service on the bar and this time the food was mediocre bartender arguing with me about the quality of food very bad service,0
how can this place even be considered a place to eat the food is horible we had to return our dishes for being cold there was actual wilted lettuce that couldnt even be considered food for turtles how can you mess up french fries,0
so im waiting in line to order take out and watch the 2nd round of the nfl playoffs and the hostess informs me i have to be seated to order take out really failnnid like to give no stars if yelp allowed,0
so disappointing the space feels like a cafeteria the food is underwhelming the food looks good but not the best quality very good service however and i sure hope for everyones sake employed there the place is reworked,1
i am really surprised by the reviews  we were there for lunch  for a buffet i thought the quality was great and there was a ton of variety  lunch was still a pretty good deal  guess i need to go try the wynns next visit and compare,3
let me get straight to the point dont come herenni paid 3800 for a mediocre mealand that was just the lunch pricennits a typical buffet with a variety of food but the food wasnt amazing at all the only items i really enjoyed was the prime rib and dessert barnnrefund please,1
excellent  it has indian food good for vegetarians they make a salad in front of u whixh is good cuz they can properly toss it,3
food allergy reviewnnthey had a great selection of gluten free items  all gf items had an asterisk next to the name  pizza desserts italian india latin etc all had gf options and they were all very tasty  its good to know that theres a reliable place i can go to when im in vegas,4
we have been to all of the buffets on the strip over time  i will tell you that for the price and quality this is one of the best  clean fantastic quality of seafood and so many other items to choose from if you are not a seafood person  great buffet,4
not my favorite buffet in vegas the price was pretty similar to the wicked spoon but half the selection and quality the service was also disappointing the plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled felt like a cafeteria,1
the owners really know their stuff the food isnt over priced and they will get what you need if its healthy and available great selection of dog jackets good loyalty program,4
waited for ever for the host to appear never did i had to walk into the restaurant and find myself a table they need an complete overhaul of their staff nnfood was standard thai it was ok nothing great though,1
good but not worth the price,2
if i could give this zero stars trust me i would we had ordered garlic shrimp and three cups chicken which both were supposed to have garlic flavor the food came in 2 minutes indicating that it was not fresh the food has no flavor of garlic,0
all flavors are substandard by far worst in east valley instead of being smooth  flavorful they are icy even my 7 year old didnt eat hers,0
do not go here  we bought a bouquet for 50 that only lasted 2 days  i used to work in a flower shop and flowers should be lasting longer than that  i am not happy  money down the drain,0
always nice to come here for lunch the sandwiches are of course made super fast and the staff is uniformly friendly,3
howard the owner can be rude and unwelcoming the rest of the staff are great,0
simply amazing in details and taste a must for the love of food,4
i was really excited for our dinner to scarpetta with some friends the service was good but the food was very underwhelming i just expected more from scott conant the food wasnt bad just average and at the prices youre paying to dine here the food better not be average,1
had a wonderful meal here the scallops appetizer was excellent thanks to the squash bed and accessory toppings the veal loin was about as perfect as humanly possible the nutella bombs were a nice sweet finish all was helped by a polished professional waiter,3
first time here food is good and customer service very good price is good love it,4
the food was actually pretty tasty but the service i received spoiled the whole thing  in this economy im not spending 8 on a 6 in sub to be treated rudely  i can go to port of subs or capriottis to the the same quality for less,1
14 bucks for a meatball hero unreal walked out with my hands over my headcompletely robbed place sucks,0
bummer i was just there a month ago and had a good sandwich stopped by friday 727 and the place is closed with paper over all the windows,0
the food is okay the rice is really weird,2
this place is great but i dont think its open anymore   it was closed for a few months due to fire or something   has it reopened,3
pretty expensive considering the price of one cup of frozen yogurt is the price of a meal at most campus restaurantsnna good variety of things you can add on nndont like the bubble tea far from what i had in chicago chinatown,2
way overratedit is huge but i found a hair in my food and i have been burping up what i did eat all dayit was 4500 plus tip for 2 adults and 2 childreni will never go back,0
this place sucks  period  im a big fan of buffet and frankly this place is what makes people hate buffets  never again,0
i really hate cold buffet food nd today all items were cold maybe we arrived too soon after opening but we had to leave and i asked for a refund i was given a gift card for a return visit which was nice,1
lins is honestly the most amazing buffet ever  maybe if you guys stop being disgusting and making a mess it wouldnt be so dirty  the food is great and for a very reasonable price,4
great work day gym to hit during lunch  just wish they would stop playing teeny bopper estrogen music in the mens locker room  damn,3
horrible service is an understatement  everything wrong lower your standards,0
love this place  everything i have tried is excellent  i love ordering online and doing takeout  great healthy yummy food,4
i love this hotel and the staff when i come back to the phoenix area i will stay at the hyatt place again and again they have shuttle and will take you to casino arizona or to main and sycamore light rail and bus stop nim not a big fan of their breakfast,3
fair,2
good fries,3
it was closed but   the building  is awesome and the locations on the water is fantastic,2
there for lunch and am not impressed  the burger was fine but not exceptional  the service was slow and sloppy  there were two people in the restaurant when we arrived they left and two more came in so it certainly wasnt a busy lunch hour,1
as others had mentioned it was just ok needed some food during a long layover so it did the job nothing spectacular nice slide show of sammy though and nice memorabilia,1
big selection and nice people definitely going back to check out more,4
the crew here is the bestthe hawaiian guy in the front makes you not even think about stealing the mobile department always hooks it up when it comes to the best plans great staff,3
so dirty i was afraid to take my shoes off is there a way to give a quarter star,0
very fast proffessional and a good value,4
they charge a 10 restocking fee the employees will not tell you about it till you bring the item back even if you ask about the return process,0
i went in and asked if i could get my computer that was repaired the employee responded with i dont know can younnhis response was rude  and very uncomfortable he then made me wait for 25 minutes as he continued to just stand around nnonce again terrible experience do not go to this store,0
nice store but now after a couple visits here i actually drive 25 min to the chandler store because they always seem to have more friendly helpful employees enough said with 3 iphones 3 ipads and 3 macbooks in our family ive always had a pleasant experience in chandler,2
this place seems like a tourist trap the food was not great wish we had gone somewhere else,1
closed 071313,0
love this place we come here every time we come to vegas you can find anything and everything here for a souvenir,4
went for the first time last week  great patio  as far as food only had nachos  wow i cant believe restaurants use cheese wiz  come on lets use some real cheese please,1
good place to go watch sports and just hang out with your friends food is pretty standard bar food and has good service  mixed crowd on saturday night i enjoyed my experience,2
always a great place to staynvery clean and attentiventhey offer free internet and a great tapas bar to unwind from a long day away from home and family nnwhen traveling on personal trips the hinton would be my go to hotel very close to metro and other fine dining,4
awesome nall the ingredients are very fresh ncarne asada is very smoky and tastynthe spicy guacamole is out of this world ill be chasing this guacamole recipe next time i make some,4
this place rocks  the carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole and the other homemade salsas is sheer perfection  super friendly service as well,4
food might have been good however they were out of rice guacamole and oh ya carne asada,0
i love this place a true hidden gem,4
pretty nice bar area  its quiet enough to just chill nnseemed like the older crowd likes this bar better though so if youre in your 20s you will feel out of place p,2
the fish and chips was some of the best i have ever had and the drinks were pretty good i recomend this over the actual resturaunt,4
great gym very honest ngreat teachers very friendly nand great kids program nlose weight get in shape and kick some butt,4
food quality was very disappointing our medium rare steaks came out very well done and the chicken tasted like cardboard there are many better choices out therennon the plus side the mojitos were great,0
i fell in love with this place so much that i went back the next day to try more food and cocktailsni love the pretzels they serve with cocktails and the cucumber gimlets are amazing,4
i dont know if the management changed again  the place smells of cleaning supply when you enter the buffet is horrible its almost like the dishes are fightng for the worst tasting food competition,0
closed  sadly cafe krishnas service went down hill in the last few months and they have now closed  hopefully the replacement will be as good as krishna was before the change in staff,1
not a whole lot of ambiance going on which i was used to at box  a very medical office type environment but the staff is really friendly  love the australian wax for its gentleness on my skin but wasnt thrilled with the results  wasnt as thorough as other waxes,2
have been going to bitzee mamas for years only for breakfast but now will be back again posole is my fav the portion was enormous will probably ask for additional fixings next time,3
great selection of toppings and yogurt super clean friendly atmosphere the only place i will get yogurt from  do yourself a favor and go get some,4
i ordered the sizzling rice soup as a bowl and the server failed to tell us that if we got the combo meal it would come with soup then after we already ordered the soup i asked if we could cancel it and just get combos and the manager said no terrible customer service i will never be back,0
par experience considering it was a dennys in a casino the pancake puppies were to die for though definitely try them while you can the wait service was decent and the food well its a dennys,2
dennys with more parking than the one on the strip service is still horrible a standard dennys signature service marker nothing else really different other than the fact that youre in las vegas and probably need to sober up before your long drive home it gets the job done as you would expect,1
terrible food and service,0
growing up just outside of la i know good mexican food this joint is solid from the salsa dollar tacos to the killer burritos you just gotta ask for cheese and avocado in yours,3
my husband loves this placetheir food is delicious and very affordable whenever we get a craving for mexican food we come here,3
i have only had the pizza here  did not impress me just fair to average pizza  i have no plans to try it again,1
a nice place for a quick business lunch in fort mill or just a quick drive up from rock hill ngrouper is always nice as is the southern style crab cakesnnservice is always pleasant and friendly and have taken the daughter in for a lunch and they are definitely kid friendly,2
started out with she crab soup it was excellent should of had a bowl instead of a cup fish tacos where great will come back again for dinner,4
the shrimp and grit here is great the menu is a bit more expensive than similar style restaurants but they do provide good food its a very laid back and wonderful atmosphere for personal or group dining would definitely come back if im in the area again,2
we grabbed antoher quick meal in here tonight and they pulled it off yet again the food was great the service was friendly and unlike last time i saw that they offer free wifi for customers  feel free to order the carne asada yelp its excellent,4

18 bucks w tax for all you can eat sushibbqwhatevernnmy favorites  sake sushi orange chicken lo mein and the fried sesame rice ballsnnfor allyoucan eat it has a good price and food that actually tastes decent  thats tough to beat,3
typically a nickel to seven cents cheaper than the national average and a better than average store always congested and on a very busy corner but worth the stop just in gas savings,2
im sitting in here right now trying to work and they are blasting glenn beck super loud ay yi yi time to leave,1
this place is always packed whenever i come here  its good typical doityouself yogurt stand  nice staff  i like that they have games here it makes for a fun night out with the family,2
omb best place for relaxing after work copper is the best beer ive ever had,4
service is slow drinks are nothing to write home about  i wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short  nni always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides starbucks but it seems this place is just missing the mark,1
i dont know about 8 lobster but 33 lobster split 2 ways was phenom we had surf and turf at 25 each top notch next time maybe the duck,4
all i can say is delicious from their pho to the fried rice to their rice plates  everything is just delicious  if you dont believe me see for yourself,3
the phu00f2 is so good the decor and feel of the restaurant was nice too servers were friendly it was a nice experience for my first time here,4
the best pho in town been getting my hangover cure here for a very long time than the sweet cashier girl is always so nice and remebers you everytime nmy favorites arenshrimp chips and spring rolls as an apnlarge rare beef pho beef on side and extra limesnyummmmmmmmy,4
hole in the wall with mediocre food would not go back,1
verdict good before but meh now nnthis place was pretty good and always gave us exactly what we ordered but now they give us half the portions of what we used to get nni dont know if maybe they recently changed owners but we wont be coming back here anymore,1
this place as accommodated big parties and small get togethers with friends the food is cheap but tastes great service has been very good,4
got two chocolate croissants and 1 mini cake  nnif im paying 23 dollar for a croissants at least enough chocolate for taste,2
the worst sushi and bad service super rudenon the sushi its 99 rice and 1 fish nvery old fish  bad flavors,0
theres nothing i can really complain about maybe that its so good and popular you wait a little bit because the menu is so good and theres lots of people lol the halibut sashimi is great the charlie sheen roll is good crab salad is yum have some sake and enjoy good sushi for the price,3
their regular customers are not very friendly if you are not a packers fan we had great service from our waitress this place is perfect for a green bay packers fan their wings were good,0
cool hipster place ndont expect a regular place and take this place for what it is  ni once forgot my credit card and this place gave me my drink and snack as a pay later wow i was so impressed that a busy town place is trusting like that i paid the very same day,4
great spot good sandwiches and sides awesome beer selection one of my favorites in queen city,4
this in my opinion is the best gourmet food in all of vegas  the menu is ever changing and the drinks outta of this world hidden gem i had the short rib  gorgonzola polenta it was amazing,3
very good food  also try brownstone pinot grigio  great friendly service,4
good breakfast joint they have all the basics plus the catchy protein pancake it is good but id like fresh blueberries in it not the canned kind like when you make blueberry muffins,3
tasty food juicy dumplings service is less than average nntake out frozen dumplings also cook well just dont thaw before cooking,3
soup watery food mediocre salad was pure vinegar,1
a great place for lunch the penne primo is super tasty and the breaddip is also yummy the service is always friendly at around 6 a plate how can i not be a big fan,3
its like a tiny part of my years in japan or a stolen post street japantown shopping area from san francisco  a nice selection of fresh food japanese sweets and cooking reagents as well as various home products  did i mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi  good,3
great condo unitreally worth the time spent here,3
cold tuna frozen vegetables unremarkable servicenni travel constantly so i notice the small stuff as well as the big stuff  in my second trip to this phillips i was hoping for a better experience tan my first  next time i think i will save the dough and just go to cpk asap in terminal b,1
positivesn the waitress was very nicen they were open on christmas evennnegativesn the waitress was not remotely competentn the beer was skunkedn the frieswhich took 15 minutes to arrivewere pale and ice cold,1

this johnny rockets is better than the rest  even other johnny rockets  customer service went above and beyond what we expected  the manager was extremely helpful  they did nothing wrong but acted like they did  we would definitely return  food was excellent  shakes were great,4
like previous reviews the service sucks and not the greatest areas of town i usually get the norm for me which is a jcfthis place is always busy and they do have a tendency to skip ordersnot the best way to run a business i guess ill deal with crummy service vs waiting at a coffee shop,1
we waited 30 minutes from seating to eating and we did not order the baked pancakes that take 20 minutes to cook  the eggs were a greygreen color inside and overcooked  the pancakes were good but not enough to make up for the rest of the experience  we wont be back,1
what a wonderful experience i have been jumping from dentist to dentist for the last 5 years i am happy to say i have found a place to stay,4
nomnomnom innout burger is always good  something that is on their secret menu is animal style you get your burger and fries with cheese grilled onions and  thousand island sauceso good this location was very quick and friendly,4
i love going to this location because its on my way back to arizona and the staff is always friendly never had an issue with an order at this one they never rush you i like mine a special way and most get it right,4
probably one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh  sushi was awesome  we had the philly naruto rainbow spicy tuna rolls  the seviche was fantastic  drinks are well priced and the variety is great  i will go back often one of the better restaurants in pittsburgh  you cant go wrong with tamari,4
fancy atmosphere but the food is not all that great good yeahnspecial  not really  ntrendy  you bet ntamari  is overhyped in my opinion it highlights all the sexyfood trends but doesnt really make a niche for itself,1
i love mediterranean food and this is some of the best ive had in las vegas  prices are reasonable  i had the lamb kebab  it came with basmati rice a greek salad and grilled tomatoes and onions  i also had rice pudding for dessert  wow,3
all you can eat korean bbq  love the selections and the old lady is super nice everytime we come here,3
good prices great service great food  if you want korean and dont want the ambiance of mothers or the nastiness of korean garden come here,3

the worst korean bbq i have ever been not too much choice u can really eat also they serve some chinese japanese food wt the hell its not a real korean bbq also lets talk abt the price i walked in by myself order a ice tea to drink total for me is 28,1
first time staff is nice typical bar and typical charlotte food aka crap but if you were born in the south you may like it north people stay away,0
good drink specials the riff raff seems to come out about 103011 oclock,2
whats up with this staind wanna be band on paddys day they arent good for the crowd,0
yuck,0
went here for dinner place was empty table was sticky soda was not carbonated food took over 30 minutes to be served and everything ordered was only sandwiches and a burger the waitress was nice but nothing else about the food was worth a second visit,0
couldnt even get through to make a reservation a brief hold is not 6 minutes not getting my business,0
very average food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order,1
nothing special here food was average at best the wings were okay how can you screw up wings,1
i love the food here omg and 1245 for 3 well vodka coke drinks yummy  we had a blonde serveemarciamercsomething but she was nice,3
hungry for sushi and in vegas  got pointed here  nnhit the happy hour and there is a decent selection of things for cheap  was good but the rolls were smaller than i am used to  but 5 hot sake and kirins 5 rolls and sushi  who cares,3
sushi was alright not the best ive tasted but good enough,2
this is a colorful place  the gyro is the best  the atmosphere is a tv playing directvs greek channel very loud and old greek men playing dominos  the restaurant is a dive but the food is always good,2
i was very disappointed in this place i had driven far out to get here i live in gilbert i got the pinkbet beef mechado and pork adobo their portions are very measly they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all the only thing i liked was the pork adobo,2
dinner check breakfast check if you need a meal while stayingvisiting the fremont street area magnolias at the four queens is a great classic casino cafe service is fast and friendly and the food is good weve been a number of times and will be back again in the future,2
pretty good yogurt and toppings  always clean and staff is pleasant,2
good yogurt very clean establishment and fair prices the quality of the product is good the flavor is great three of us ate there for just about 11 which isnt bad,4
grainy and softnshould serve with a straw,0
as far as subs go this place is hands down a winner over the 5 ft lng place sandwiches are great,3
mehits cheap  its close to me  it smells like the ocean in here yes fish  cheap beers and drinks  i might have had a couple of margaritas so this rating and review could be seriously flawed  worth a visit if you like the ocean and like to eat its inhabitants,2
very generous portions  had a quesadilla for lunch and it was very good  while they give refills for the ice tea they only give a can when one orders a soda  if were to order a drink i would probably order the ice tea which i have heard from the members i was with was good,3
this bridal boutique was great our bridal consultant jessica  was so sweet and helpful  their dress selection was amazing and the prices were reasonable i highly recommend finding your dream dress here,4
i have eaten there about 5 times the food was good service was good also the atmosphere is a family type a little bit of noise but not annoying so all in all it was good for me and my family it seems to be a good place to have a large group go for dinner and not have a 2 hr wait,2
yuck the teriyaki chicken did not look or taste like chicken the price for the portion size was too damn high,0
lime service is on point but vodka ojs have to be approved by management rules are rules though,4
it is bad in every way possible we called and asked if they were busy and they hung up  very expensive for low quality food half the orders came out after everyone else was done eating the salad was literally half a cup of chopped lettuce,0
wow what a great mexican place the most amazing collection of sauces ive ever seen their homemade sauce was enough though the food is very tasty and the price is certainly right fish tacos ftw,3
i had been having a hard time finding a place that does good pedis and i found it  the quality of the products are superb and the service amazing  tiffany really did a great job  i would recommend to any onennanother thing i liked was a price list up front,4
been there several times mainly for the the awesome bands they have there the drinks are pretty decent and the wait staff to i like the free popcorn also i had eaten there only a couple times during lunch and wasnt really impressed ive had better burgers else where,3
i got terribles diarrhea the next day small selection of dishes,0
great food the french dip is to die for great service clean and fancy especially for the area its located in  def a hidden gem my husband and i both love going here and cant wait until next time,4
if you have a choice go to the one downtown i always get the buffalo shrimp but at this majerles the coating was too thick not to mention our ice tea tasted like dirt and service was horrible,1
food was goodplenty of tvs to watch the game but we were served a mug of beer with lipstick on it and the idiot manager opened the glass wall with it being 100 degrees out to accommodate one outside table leaving all of us at the bar to sweat our a off poor management we will never return,0
great steak sandwich and the fries have a great taste without any sauce my wife had mamas burger the bun and mushrooms were great tasting but the meat lacks flavor we will give this place another try,3
one star is very generous for this place i paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen the front desk was rude the room smelt awful and the bed was very uncomfortable also the free breakfast was a joke it was super cold and gross never stay here,0
beware i had dinner there a few nights ago and they increased the amount of the tip on my credit card  i like their food but i will never go there again if i cannot trust that they are an honest business shame,0
great big tostones very nice hot sauce and mojo everyone at my table two who had never had cuban food all cleaned their plates,3
very good authentic cuban food wish the place was a bit busier as i would like to see them succeed we had a marvelous meal and the waitress was very helpful we will go back as it is on our minds constantly,3
my wife just got a haircut at this place and she seems to be pretty happy with her experience full marks for the ambience the stylist name was nathan and he seemed to be friendly and did a great job will be going there again i strongly recommend r salon,3
honk  what a difference of opinion from the reviews read before patronizing this salon   no one wants to go into a salon and come out looking ten years older sporting a style that is tired and not becoming  not a fan of the product or the attitude wont be returning,1
it was very delicious and tastey,2
the rigatoni bolognese is amazing its my favorite dish is in this place meant to post in 2012 way delayed post,3
this place has got to be the slowest burger king on earth it also doesnt help when someone in front of you orders 36 worth of food,0
if going through the drivethrough i would check your order before leaving this bk cant get anything right,0
door guys are pretty sexy,4
drinks were good service was good and the food was as good as mexican is going to get in the pittsburgh area salsa needs some work and the tacos werent great but the tamales were surprisingly tasty ill def go back when im in town,2
my favorite friend chicken  i have not yet been to their new location but  their food is so good  cant wait to visit again,4
i dont get it is this supposed to be delicious soul food its a crap piece of chicken and a crap waffle on a plate for 8 bucks the water is from the tap i expected delicious i got below average at best back to the real restaurants for me,0
love the place great food and atmosphere all the employee looked like they were having a great timenwonderful staff i forgot and left my wallet there and they found it andntook care of it till i could return to get it thanks so much,3
delicious chicken and even better waffles the sweet tea is great but sometimes it can be too sweet give this place a try,3
the food and the service are the best seriously the nicest wait staff  the best damn food youll ever have they also happen to play my lifes soundtrack best music ever,4
great fried chicken dont plan on doing anything after though because it will give you a serious case of the idis,3
lolos is the ultimate chicken and waffle spotnot only is the food good but the atmosphere is always upbeatas you watch tv and listen to some music that will make you want to eat,3
nothing special ive had better chicken fried okra was not crispy corn bread ok i guess waffle house waffles are better but the fried chicken gizzards were excellent,1
terrible location just a couple girls gossiping about their crappy relationships totally inattentive  and irritating store looked in a disarray i will not spend my money here they didnt even acknowledge my presence,0
went on a thursday night  it was alright  not crowded at all so we didnt stay long  came back later in the night and it was even more deadnnlots of techno and dance  but we did ask the dj to play some hip hop and he squeezed two songs in,1
a friend and i decided to check this place out on saturday afternoon and all of the doors were locked we were really excited to check it out im not sure if its even open for business if it is they need some store hours posted outside,0
scarlett is really cute and she seems to have a good dynamic with her crew but her tricks are lackluster and the show isnt exactly sexy enough to make up for it nnif you can get a good deal on the tickets take it it is a true las vegas experience just dont plan your trip around it,2
when i was in san jose i always know where to go for a great vietnamese foodnfinally i found another place here when im travelling in phoenixnthis place is a local for people looking for a great vietnamese foodncant go wrong if you want an authentic vietnamese food,3
this place is amazing i love their pho dac biet and the rice dice with grilled pork and fried eggs on top,4
delicious pho and summer rolls have also had it to go which is nice service could he a bit friendlier great thai iced read and iced coffee parking can be a bit tricky but there is extra parking around back,3
this is the best breakfast in all of pittsburgh  service is always good  seating is limited but its worth the wait if you find a line,4
this was a horrible experience  i have a pretty simple hair cut but they didnt take any interest in noticing and chopped it way too shortnndont waste your time or money here,0
fri  sats latin vibes club 1130p4am great spot if you like dancing latinas  latin vibes,4
gas is cheap butnnservice sucks they dont even acknowledge you when youre at the counter if it wasnt for their cheap as heck gas id ask for the place to be demolished nndont go inside just pay with your visa at the pump and go,0
food is okay but a lil overpriced  how do you go from 699 sandwich to adding 5 more for fries and a drink  i couldve got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied,1
we stopped in for breakfast  the prices were high for very marginal foodfrozen potatoes that werent even served warm  food didnt seem very fresh either  left with that heavy ugh feeling,0
i had a great time here lost my money on a ladybug penny machine and had some drinks if you like casinos you will like it if you dont like them then you wont like it the place is beautiful and overlooks the water,3
cheap prices but nasty food,0
gluten free fried goodness this is what i think every time i eat here they have gluten free fried fish  chips and also onion rings their prices are super reasonable too located on rainbow  215 area its a great location nalso the employees are super nice i suggest everyone to try this hidden gem,4
this place is awesome lobster roll is great just wish itwas bigger the shrimp n chips amazzzzing,4
i think this mom and pop restaurant is awesome the food is great i had the lobster roll with the clam streamers granted not huge compared to something you get at the coast but living in las vegas itll help cure the ache until you can hit the coast,2
teakwoods touch em all is the best burger ever terrific wings too,3
short review herennhalf price rolls on wednesday yesnwere they good yesnwould i return yes,3

so much for that groupon tried to go there today only to find the doors closed and tables gone,0
terrible chicken was old texture was odd and the food smelt foulngross,0
im not sure why they call themselves barcelona not very authetic spanish cooking but the tapas are good they could have a bigger selection of tapas service was excelant check them out on half price night and try the sangrias free samples are available,2
was very disappointed we have frequented this restaurant before and decided to go for date night food came out way to fast and tasted like it was from old supply chicken was rubberymeatballs not donebacon dates tasted mushy so sad we will not be coming back,1
had some arizona pin stripes on my black 4runner contacted gannon detail to see if the scratches could be buffed out i posted the amazing pictures the exterior looks amazing and we are so happy,4
store closed its doors on tax day 041513 along with the location on east blvd in charlotte,2
there pizza is average the customer service us subpar and if you enjoy ranch or any extras bring your piggy bank,1
mediocre pizzannordered pizza for the super bowl and they only had half our order ready 40 minutes later pretty much ruined our party well get our pizza from some place more reliable next time,1
enjoyed my birthday dinner here this year outside in the patio area  the family loved it and it was a nice cozy way to enjoy spending the evening together mixed with great food all in all a wonderful way to celebrate,4
worst mcdonalds evertweekers spare changing freely some lady threatened to beat another ladys ass following her around yelling dirty drink area etc the building looks good as the only good point ill never return to this location if i can avoid it,0
this can company is ok the service isnt great but i do like that they do a lot of work in sustainability,3
cockroaches at this food establishment nnnot eating here again,0
gag they used an old bucket of water to wash down the inside it reeked  i had to drive home with the windows down  moldy old water and they wash the inside with that same rag for the tires  awful  its hard to find this place on the very south side of the shopping complex  skip it,0
ive been here twice because after my first time i didnt want to go back but decided to give it another try both times they were slow behind the counter trying to be like a chipotle and the food was just not enjoyable at all would rather go to chipotle or qdoba,0
staff was greatfood was average at best  not much more to say,1
looks much better inside than out  fast delicious food at a great value  could have spent the day just enjoying the soup that came with the lunch special,4
we stopped for a glass of wine and a beer i enjoyed smoking a cigar on the patio the staff was friendly  but service was slow and prices were high,2
fresh  easy is a great little grocery store it has all kinds of fresh foods it also has alcohol for all you drunks out there pnnbut seriously this place came highly recommended from my cousin and now i know why good foods great prices the staff is also pretty friendly keep it up fe,4
disgusting food tastes like frozen food that was reheated only thing good were the chips will not return,0
if they get your order right your lucky if it is right most of the time the burgers are made wrongnnot worth the stop at all,0
if you are thinking about going here because someone told you its like chipotle but better they lied we went at about 8pm the meat looked old they charge extra for peppers the freshness you would get from chipotle was lacking,1
i love the olive garden no matter what state i travel to  i have found their food to be very good and very affordable  the breadsticks and salad are always my favorite part i have to try to stop before my meal comes or i am not hungry and just have to take it home,3
dont ever go to the vietnameses guy name john i went in for long layers and left with most of my hair cut off and it looks like a freaking mullet wth thats not long layers he doesnt listen and i will never recommend this guy to even cut my dogs hair,0
alway a very good lunchmake sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal  opa,3
for the food price  service this place has to be the best gyro restaurant in avondale its a little hidden gem in this neighborhood food is always good the service is always fantastic the two young men behind the counter are always friendly  efficient definitely one of my favorite places,4
this place sucks staff was rude rooms look like army barracks we came for the ambiance and hospitality but were greeted with terrible service and poor attitudesnnwould not recommend,0
this place was probably the worst service i have ever had everything i ordered came out wrong and the girl that took my order was super rude i will for sure not be going back to this location,0
just got out of work decided id go to carls i order my food and its descent but what really made me give the place two stars would be the service it was horrible never coming back to this location,1
we love coming in two movies for the whole family for what it costs for a single ticket at amc or edwards  the food is also reasonably priced not a gouge like the aforementioned chain theaters  do yourself a favor go see all you movies here,4

the breakfast burrito was okay and for this reason i felt it was overpriced the location next to ice den and the operating hours are really great the staff are friendly and the service was fast,2
sulky customer service every time ive been here they also skimp on the portions compared to other milios locations in madison,0
cute store lots of nostalgia to look at would have loved to have bought the red ropes but they were near the front window  hard as rocks same for some of the taffy i bought prices seemed reasonable,2
if you love soda than this is the place i love the dif root beers they have there its an amazing selection one of the best stores in las vegas hands down i could go there veryday nad try something new and i would never ge tired of it at all,4
food was semi ok and they didnt refresh the trays of food as often as they shouldve but i guess for the cheap price thats the quality you get,0
very disappionted in customer service i have shopped in this store for over ten years and feel like i have been treated less than appropriately on sveral occasions  taking care of their long standing customers in difinitely  not a priority very disappionting,0

i like this place because its cheapnnthe food isnt outstanding but its tasty enoughnnwe go fairly regularly because its easynnid recommend it,2
service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking  plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising,1
so yummy great staff and awesome authentic mexican food its off the strip and well worth the drive,4
the chips are fresh so is the salsa the food was just okay  nothing that i would run back to but the shrimp ceviche and the margaritas definitely would have me running back only during happy hournthe service was a1 everyone was very nice and friendly especially my waiter claudio,2

after going to the farmers market in guadeloupe  this place was awful they are way over priced on a lot of items like fresh eggs and honey the store had so much stuff it was hard to find items and they didnt have much local items the service was so so this place is more hype than anything good,1
i love this farmers market because they carry crows dairy goat cheese  you seriously need to try this cheese  the pepper goat cheese is amazing  nnthe store is small but has a decent selection  im really just there for the cheese,3
service is the word or lack of it  wow,0
i must have caught them on a baaaddd day because all i have to say is yuck and waste of money with their chewy food felt like i walked in to a gas station and ordered chewing gum  overpriced for the quality of food  threw 90 of it away,0
this place is horrible one of the employees crashed my car and rather than having them fix the problem they refuse to answer my call  dont attend the phoenix 7st location,0
i love this car wash they may take longer than others in the valley but they actually clean and vacuum the entire vehicle  my only complaint is that like all the other car washes they try to up sell you on services  but that didnt happen today ngive them a try and i think you will be pleased,2
they have always treated me well i will review the car and have them touch up some issues  the staff is friendly  i have never had to worry about honesty  they will buff things out if needed,3
fair price privately owned with friendly service and they actually know what they are doing this is a really good alternative to the chains,4
sent my wife here once even though i i had followed her home the day before and checked to make sure all her lights were working front and back these guys seem to find two lights out keep in mind this was three years ago but never forgot it and now you know,0
never and i say never input your real social security  and phone s unless you want to be harassed for the rest of your life  the kicker is theres no way to close your account or stop being harassed even after you click unsubscribe,0
i first contacted liz after another accountant botched my 2008 taxes and got me in seemingly deep trouble with the irs liz went through line by line and corrected the errors then wrote a clear and thoughtful letter to the irs explaining the honest mistake highly recommended,4
fuck you yelp for removing my review bintch harbor island apartment suck ass crack with a sick dick,0
takes forever for pizza to bake double dough is super flimsy pan pizza has so much dough love the cheese they use but makes for a puddle of grease too spendy to frequent,2
rosatis was my go to while in kansas city so i was glad to have one close that delivers the pan and double dough are my favorite as well as the calzone and a decent salad,3
great place for drinks and happy hour,3
the food is great we had curry chicken  sesame chicken and tempura shrimp hot and sour soup all of  the food was great,3
im sorry but this is not a pad thai the food was awful the service nobody checked on us i have to look for somebody to bring me the bill never ever back here,0
beautiful restaurant in the ritz carlton had hamburger  fries attending business conference at the ritz,3
would love to see them offer healthy options  whole wheat pasta salads with lite dressings and more vegetarian vegan options would be great   the biscuits with sausage gravy shake and bake pork double stuffed potatoes and pizza are great but will kill you eventually,2
this is me and my friends favorite spots after a night out i love there salsa bar there tacos burritos and sopes are on point,3
overpriced and underfun this was more trouble than it was worth and the crime scenes were grated and boring probably ok for kids but if youre over 12 skip it,1
had issues over parking i went in to discuss them with the owner and found him to be most unfriendly i will wont be eating here and would encourage others to stay away also,0
the service was outstanding the food not so my firecracker wontons fried with fillings were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber the burn taste ruined the meal good service and great coffee but i will stick with macaroni grill,1
great eats even if you dont get the all you can eat spaghetti had the arugula and white bean salad plus two penne pasta dishes both very good good italian food in a nice atmosphere at decent prices with good waitstaff,2
i love this place great prices and even better food i try something different every time and am never disappointed,4
i love the location it is very little main street feeling the food is good and priced very well the service is slow so i would not come here if you are in a rush,2
royal mile is beautiful its a lovely cobbled street that runs on a hill with pubs and shops and restaurants on either side when its empty its great to walk down and when its really busy during the festival with people advertising their plays its even more awesome i love it,3
my friends and i saw this show last week and i thought it was thoroughly entertaining  they sang many classics and added a personal touch by including  their love of singing motown as teenagers  it was a great show,4
really want to like this place have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were smallespecially for the price save your money and your tastebudsgo somewhere else,0
as far as saloncafes go this has got to be one of the better ones  the sandwiches while not particularly ground breaking are thoughtful and assembled with quality components  also has a pretty good oldtown ambiance,3
i had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree great flavors although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini the rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab nndefinitely heading here again to try more,3
good food lots to pick from on buffet  great for the kids,3
best brunch in madison and spectacular bloody marys lunch and dinner fare is tasty love the atmosphere large number of big screens and big beer selection,4

i came here for a staycation and couldnt be happier the room is fabulous and the hotel exceeds my expectations  food court is a hot mess eat before you get here,3
bailey is great  gave me exactly what i wanted and and was very knowledgeable great experience,4
i go to ari sushi whenever i can good rolls great price for the area so close to scottsdale i just love pretty much everything about the atmosphere and feel of the place too nice for people who want a feel of a family sushi place they actually place japanese music too,3
last two visits very poor rude service  very disappointing  i will not be back for a long time need to get the bad taste out of my mouth,1
well lit clean courteous help great looking produce organized well maintained and the marinated bulgogi and sides taste great  will be returning soon,4
caramel frap and hot chocolate were good but very disappointed in vanilla cappuccino half of the cup is foam and not a lot of vanilla,1
chicken kabobs were tasty however the spinach wraps clearly tasted of freezer funk so i ordered the orzo soup and hummus instead the hummus was great but my soup had about three grains of orzo in it wont be coming back,1
searched this place before we gowent to this place with a friendthe food was ok service was okthe place is ekkkkkkkkk i would not go back again,1
ok so all the negative reviews made me nervous frank was actually better than blue man and criss angel  i agree that you need to be at least 30 years old to enjoy it and also enjoy stand up comedy wish the tickets were cheaper it was a good show the band was great,2
i come to this location pretty much everyday staff is always friendly but the drink i order venti iced stirred caramel macchiato they repeat my order and yet again today i was handed not stirred and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer,1
customers are good thats all,0
waitress the turkey burger is cold can you recook we brought another ah look its pink and uncooked sorry we are learning the grill thats my review i hope its better for you food is not a priority,1
good customer service but overpriced low quality sushi,1
wide comfortable reclining chairs perfect for cuddling and watching a movie  yes please  so worth the extra 3 it costs over harkins,4
this guy is amazing i brought in a picture of how i wanted my hair cut and he made it happen its not easy to do asian hair our hair will stick up like crazy if cut wrong the only thing i would say is parking was a bit of an issue overall he is fast,3
they took off my original review because i told the truth they did a horrible job and took forever and still didnt get the order right sad mexican food,0
this is one of the first places we stumbled into after moving to las vegas being from the south we are use to super friendly wait staff and this place didnt disappoint the pizza is awesome and we love to sit in their courtyard when its cool definitely our only pizza place in town,3
not impressed with my last visit pizza was not good and service wasnt either,1
decent coffee for whats located in a hotel that was off the strip without driving off to get starbucks this place is definitely liveable when you walk your butt down the elevators after a drunk night or a night of betting,1
the fries are really good  the turkey sandwich was creative and big but the processed turkey slices didnt quite cut it whatever they use for the bun was way too small and they didnt mix enough dried cranberries with the mayo  it was good and filling but nothing to write home about,2
hi ashley n   thank you for your response during the day our experience has been fine i think your night crew is not as polished as i said gimme sugar has excellent macaroons we may be back we will go during the day though when your service is better nnthank you naustin gold,1
carbonated solutions of las vegas cleaned my moderately soiled area rug in their plant and it looks like brand new  these guys did an amazing job  they were on time for pick up and delivery  i would definitely use them again,4
kokomos rocks  this place is so clean and all their toppings are sooo fresh we go there 2x per week and love to see the place packed all the time glad u r in town,4
this is your onestop chinese takeout shop  hunan park never disappoints and they always have your order ready super quick  i highly recommend the general tsaos chicken  if you order takeout for dinner be sure to ask for utensils or have your own overall solid across the board,3
worst starbucks ever long lines and ineffective staff sub par baked goods i guess they feel they can get away with bad service because the convenience of being located in the hotel thats a shame,0
a terrible company went to get business cards for my new small businesstalked to travis the graphic designer about what i wanted and he seemed like he was happy to help but now a month later and after multiple calls i have heard no responseshould change their name from never late to never received,0
decent mexican food at reasonable prices would not be my first choice for mexican,2
lobbys is great i give the establishment itself three stars it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold but the burgers oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars these big juicy sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge,3
deliciously flavorful juicy burgers and fries  my boyfriend says its one of the best italian beefs he has ever had  i would like to see more on the menu but it is a good thing that they stick to what they do best beef,3
excellent beef sandwiches a little to juicy but very good chicago style italian beef fries are good with there dipping sauce hot dogs are very good too the cute girls arent bad to look at either i would share my hot dog with them and share my fries,3
the owner is there every day and he takes his food seriously he loves for people to come in and it shows  the burgers are just so good hot juicy and tasty the milkshakes are to die for my husband generally hates takeout but even he loves this place i highly recommend lobbys burgers,4
their veggie burger is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly,4
great taste i got the bacon burger it was amazing the place was clean and staff was friendly as for the price cant complain we will absolutely be coming back,3
a true gem for phx and the west valley area the owner provides an intimate experience and isnt afraid to offer insight on the best way to partake of the dishes all the food was absolutely fantastic,4
food was fair heavy on the sauce on our dishes and even the kids didnt like their noodles service was good for the quality it was expensive,1
sweets  beats is amazing plenty of coolweirdunusual stuff to look at besides the recordsi find something i want everytime i go this is unlike any other store youll find in aznthe candy that foams in your mouth is awesomei highly recommend,4
i come from the land of publix so imagine my disappointment when i moved here  there is no seafood department there is a lack of selection and cleanliness in the meat department  they only ever have one or two  checkout lanes open plus the self checkout open  use the self checkout if you dare,1
food and drinks are expensive and in all honesty not really worth the price  theyre pretty much just regular hot dogs with over the top toppings  you can count on long lines and hunting for a place to seat and theyve got nothing on my all time favorite hot dogs flos in cape neddick maine,2
yuckwhy are their food cold  not 1 not 2 but 6 of usnni hope the one their are opening at lax will be better than this one,1
this place is overrated service was horrible food was cold would rather have boiled hotdogs stay away,0
fell way short of all the hype from what im reading la is better but i cant imagine them being that much better for starters i did not care for the hard casings on the dogs flavor was not that great either i really think this place gets by on their image more than their food,1
overpriced for a hot dog but you do get a huge ass wienernnim a girl that craves nacho cheese after midnight so the mojave dog was the hot dog of choice and boy did it hit the spot  nnim glad they were open at 2am  and i didnt have to go looking for a 711,3
had a groupon and now kind of wish i didnt was hoping for a good dog but ended up with an upset belly,1
food is unimpressivenndrinks however try the lemonade or the margarita both with alcohol and you will not regret it,2
hits the spot four stars for salty fries and polish dog location in la better though,3
we had a groupon for jello shots at pinks we had green apple blueberry  grape we took them outside on the nice little patio area to people watch the jelloo shots were really good and the outside seating is always a plus,3
it ok not worth all the hype no space look kind of dirty in the kitchen will never want to eat there again,1
i oredered take out the other night and they forgot to include the ranch and celery thanksfully i had some at home but its not the point over the years bww has gone downhill and this location is no exception,1
just average nothing great you can get the same food in any bar around town except bagels you can get those fresh at smiths if your hungry and have no other choice heres your place,1
eat here if you like terrible music playing loudly in your ear 12 vodka tonics made with sprite and hair rude servers food that may or may not make you vomit four times in the middle of the night and slow service seriously dont go here if your life depends on it,0
11 for a washingmachine margarita on the strip rude service and the bar is chilly and drafty in the winter not sure why i got suckered into going here but never again,0

food was good texmex fare  margarita was one of the worst id ever had  i was totally dumbfounded that their margaritas could be so bad order a beer and youll be fine,2
45 for two frozen machine margaritas and two shots of sammy hagars shit tequila  they print on receipt suggested tip of 12  this place stunk like they had sewer issues behind the bar  it left such a bad taste in my mouth that i will flip the station next time i hear a sammy hagar song,0

good service but horrible garbage food and small portions,0
fresh sushi fresh sushimi rolls best udon soup you can get in madison  and this is a buffet frog legs tamuri mushrooms shrimp and the sunday seafood buffet is unbelievable even for the 20 per person price tag its well worth it fresh wasabi too plus ice cream scooped out for you  not soft serve,4

nice but the menu it is stil the same  for the past 6 yearswe are in montreal nnanyways the best dish for me is the radish oyster  cannot get enough of the stuff 12cad for 4 oysters is well worth itnnthe rest to my taste was quite ordinary not worth the money,2

as part of my bachelorette weekend my friends surprised with a classy afternoon for some tea and a tiny tiny lunch    i wish they would have more scones and the mini sandwiches and less dessert but everything was pretty delicious,3
my only complain is if you are going to add 18 gratuity please inform the guest first i used to be a server i always inform the guest verbally or written on the check its really shady especially comes from an international hotel chain,2
from my walking around this was the best value margarita station 13 half yards with 10 refills on the main strip and the drinks didnt disappoint  lots of different flavors to choose from too,4

i received the worst service ever tonight nothing like a moody shift manager with a attitudenot a good look for you mcdonalds,0
i was a bit dubious about a cafe that advertises coffee that doesnt taste like coffee but the espresso was decent not awesome but better than starbucks,2
hard to rate a massage place seeing as they definitely make you feel better than when you came in it should be yes or no rating whatever the case the mo membership is worth it,3
i truly love golds clean facility  friendly staff and my favorite part  the cardio cinema  not to mention the wonderful personal trainers namely jamie she is always friendly and motivating ive learned so many great work outs that i can easily replicate at home the prices are reasonable as well,4
their dumplings are great but everything else tastes like something you could find in the freezer section at the grocery store not to mention we waited over 30 minutes for our togo order i would understand if it was really busy or something but we were the only ones there,1
have eaten here at least 4 times and the food was poor every time,0

i went into transformations for a consultation  the experience was horrible the facility is gorgeous but the people especially dr afifi were unkind impatient  had very little knowledge  of the procedure i was interested in or any people skills do not use this clinic,0
the staff seems to enjoy talking to each other rather then help customers  the place seems more like a chucky cheese than a really rockys  i go out of my and go to the monona drive location  they seem to be the friendliest and best quality,0
best fast food burritos in town pancheros doesnt touch this place adobe is a close second go with the barbacoa,4
its fair to say im a regular here the service is always fast and efficient with a smile my favorite is a chicken bowl it is always tasty i sometimes get chips with guacamole their guacamole is delicious and always fresh,3

we love golden harvest huge delicious portions make busy nights easy friendly staff weve been coming for years and will continue,4

they have great deal on taco tuesday its 1 per taco i bring all my kids for the night so i dont have to cook their salsa bar is pretty good too,2
we stopped in for dinner on friday night  there was a table open and we waited right at the front door for the host  we waited and waited  the two waiters could have easily sat us  the bartender kept looking over at us and nothing  i do not recommend this place,0
this place is overrated  it was fine but not at all special not a single one of the dishes we ordered stuck out to me as being especially good  sorrynnconsidering how many great restaurants there are in vegas there is no reason to come here,1
we stumbled in off the plane and had a tasty lunch for 2 people  calamari a la plancha xato salad scallops in romesco sauce white ceviche and raspberry tuna skewers  it was all good and beautifully presented no drinks 80 for a light lunch felt a bit steep,2
the food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes for three of us at lunch the bill before tip was 105  we didnt even have drinks service was good too but again i cant justify the price,1
overall great experience the mixed seafood ceviche was amazing i wish the portion was a bit larger i would definitely come back i also tried the paella which was also delicious,3
we were excited to try julian serrano because of their ceviche and array of tapa menus i ordered the mixed seafood ceviche it was meh okay  nothing special  also the steamed the mussels that were pretty good  the other girls ordered the spare ribs and mushroom risotto  nothing specatuclar,2
love the pizza reverse happy hour special  especially the wings and pretzels beer is obviously the best part,4
amore is now closed and the store is cleared out,2
the toddy was good the food not so much it was pricey and there were a few too many flies buzzing around for my liking,0
the store was really good but the restaurant was terrible the food and the service were awful i found a hair in my coffee and on my breakfast plate,0
everyone else enjoyed it so i guess im on my own  it was just ok  it went too long for my tastes so my friend and i ditched out after an hour and change  i think it was close to over but we had seen enough lip syncing for a night,2
i caught divas at the linq theater fabulously hosted by entertainer and er nurse brian keith it was raucous hilarious and inappropriate on a grand scale and that was just mr keith i defy anyone no matter how uptight to keep from singing along,4
it is little pricy but they give you o much meat that it makes up for it  i have only has the gyros  the have good food beer and wifi great place to go for lunch in between classes at gcc,3
cant comment on the food  after 20 minutes and no server we left too bad my wife and i enjoying new dishes  not recommended,0
this place was awesome we tried what we felt were their best offerings the tequenyos domino empanada pabellon arepa gouda chachapa and the pabellon patacon you want to eat the pabellon patacon the gouda chachapa was also a home run cant wait to go back,4
the food was pretty good but there was a hair in my sandwich i obviously couldnt finish i was very disappointed,0
we have loved this place for years i have never had a bad meal im surprised at so many 1 reviews,4
when we were still living in gilbert az me and husband went this place countless times whatever we tried did not disappoint us their lad na is so good our all the time favorite is grilled salmon with mango salad cooked to perfection  nladies are friendly and helpful,4
i gave this sushi place a try since its around summerlinwhere i live it was a togo order the sushi were not well made they rolls dont look presentable one of the rolls i got is a salmon roll to my surprise the salmon is cooked not fresh,0

its a very close distance to ny my hotel where we were staying the prices are great they have gluten free pancakes which is awesome the food is really good compare to its price range nothing fancy but practically good,3
poor service waited too long for waitress  kim to take our order  not happy will very likely eat somewhere else next time,0
grrrrnhated itni love this chainbut hate this location,0
get there before rush hour so you can miss the traffic nnthe staff is the only reason i cant give this 5 stars they seemed pre occupied you dont want to seem like this when  you are getting stuck with needles it just is a bit upsetting nnthe mobile team is awesome though,3
great rolls and bread,2
not very fresh rice was hard beans crusted over taste was ok maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired with many other burrito options no reason to come here,1
golds is a nice lounge but there is something missing from this place that makes it kinda blah over all but was a nice place to grab a quick drink with friends,1
about the worst service you can imagine waitresses had no idea about 2 for 1 drink coupons being handed out in the aria casino also there are few tables but apparently this was too much for wait staff to handle 3 tv screens were good,0
i love this place ive been coming me for a few years now they treat you like family here,4
nice facilities line guys are awesome desk staff not so much fuel is uberexpensive but ramp fees arent too bad if you dont meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee  this is what you get when theres no competitors on the field,1
i hope youre not here for anything other than nostalgiannone orange julius please  bamthat does the tricknnwhats not to love about an orange julius  whats to love about hot dogs from a roller grill,2
such good chinese food pleasantly surprised,3

these guys are quick and very sweet i registered online and at the last minute had to have them come to my work and pick me up did not take 15 min the are the best i was in and out in time to take my daughter to work love them,4
best shrimp fried rice ever prices are normal but the food is above avg i try to make it here 2 times a month,4
the service in this place sucks the waiters are freaking rude they really need to learn how to behave with customers apart from the wings this place is a hell no,1
service was good but definitely dont order a bagel especially if you are used to having one at city deli or brueggers  ice cream was yummy,1
terrible 2nd time we have ordered from this location wait over an hour both times and we live less than 5 min away main thing is taste is disgusting taste just like store bought digiorno hard crust way more crust than cheese and just no flavor  going back to dominoes or papa johns,0
i signed up for a 30 min massage i was not impressed nnthe upstairs has leaks in the ceiling  additionally when you are in the massage area you can hear everything that is going on downstairswhich is not even mildly relaxing nnas far as massageive had better at a fraction of the price,1
great place everyone was so nice my 2 yr old is usually a nightmare in the chair but after a rough few minutes and a different movie he was great it was like a miracle and his haircut is adorable they did a great job would definitely recommend it,3
food was very good an tasted fresh the cat fish an shrimp was amazing i will go back,3
this place is now las americas and its colombian food its authentic and the people are nice but nothing about it really stood out,2
drive through is a plus especially at 550 in the morning nnstaff seems tired and not unfriendly just not welcoming like other places overall a clean store though but ya nothing too special here,2
id say this is a pretty good off broadway but i was disappointed in the boot selection  i felt like there was a lot more cheap looking pointy toe heeled boots and not enough cute flat ones  i did find a very cute pair of gray suede franco sarto heels for a great price so it wasnt all bad,2
my family and i have been to this location several times and its always an adventure the staff seems clueless about their jobs they mess the order up and they have no regard that the customer is watching all of this i need to find a different location and let the keystone cops have this location,0
pizza is very good and if you go on wednesdays they have thier wacky wedneday special large 1topping for 599  free flavored crust and usually quick service  the employee even offered us free drinks while we waited in the dining room,4
great balkan style lunch menunexcellent hummus fresh salad and vegetables and the chicken skewers were also very well seasoned but a little bit drynservice was very friendly,3
so so food had kung pao chicken and its just like every other strip mall chinese joint around here lots of celery in the food wife had cashew chicken and it looked about the same actually if it wasnt for the nuts you couldnt tell them apart by looking at them,1
food lion strip mall chinese food also offers deliver experience had always been good and food is exactly as youd expect,2
super rip off took the car in for an oil change they recommended 2000 of repairs i left and took it to a mechanic who i trust all it needed was 230 for brake pads firestone wanted 450 for that stay away from this place unless you have money you dont want,0
they were worthless when the screen in my galaxy cracked from from dropping it no help at all,0
stopped in on my way to work to grab a coffee  they have 2 cashiers and only 1 guy making the drinkswth super slow  this location is not recommended if you are in a hurry,1
the food was fine and the service is friendly if not the most efficient not a place i would go out of my way for a return visit but wouldnt rule it out if someone else suggested it,2
good space has all the equipment you need only problem is too many personal trainers its a public gym not a personal training studio,3
i had an inspection and oil change there was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man i will not be back,1
closed several months ago  now another restaurant named aroma,0
i have been a regular at malibu for 3 years but was very disappointed with my last visit  they are under new management and would not honor my gift certificate also the smell of burning incense was overwhelming,0
best place great service and selection also very competitive and after much of comparison shopping i was back nlinas was very friendly and knowledgeable he is very passionate for what he does and i saw him taking care of customers ndefinitely coming back,4
the place is now amor de brazil which is a much better place than phil and tonys ever was,0
old school in the best sense of the word  superior quality great service friendly team cash only means cost stays low  my car hasnt been that clean in a long time  and i wasnt expecting them to detail it  great to know there are still businesses like this around,4
as a grocery storeits ok what really surprised me is when i went to their meat department looking for knockwurst the guy in the meat department didnt even know what that was and referred me to harris teeter wtf,1
this place could be excellent but they fail in the small details first off the staff is not very friendly and we had a bad waitress very impatient the food is good but it is hard to lay out good money for an attitude when there is three more great places to eat in belmont,1
upscale food and wine shopping and lovely patio dining attracts out of area patrons for their unique ambiance be sure to try it when youre in belmont,3
the barista made my frappuccino really watery and too sweet  also the whipped cream is melted  target sbux taste way better,0
great little family bakery with great pastry and juices  the owners are so nice and passionate about what they do  cant wait to come back  really love their empanadas,4
i received a fantastic pedicure here but my manicure was poorly done it was rushed 80 for a deluxe pedi and gel mani kinda steep,2
the food is reasonablly priced and always comes out hot weve never had a bad meal,3
this is not a bad place for lunch i ordered a burrito in a bowl topped with chicken cheese salsa onions sour cream and parsley it is very similar to chipotle however i still like chipotle better nnthey have a couple windows seats that has a god street view making it an ideal spot to people watch,2
way over priced the service was terribleneed i go on,0
i enjoyed the stromboli the place was hectic with trivia but otherwise fine would return,2
lost their lease closed for business,0
i was in austin tx last month for a long spa weekend at a wellknown resort but nathans 90 minute massage at n8 touch was better than anything id ever had  i havent been to the chiropractor there but ill definitely be going back to the facility as long as nathan is there,4
big clean carries lots of variety some is overpriced the rest is about average,3
expect more for a 10 sandwich this is next a series of all mediocre reviews friendly servers but it needs some creativity in the kitchen and please show the chef where the spice rack is,1
checked this place out for the first time  with the exception of it being very hot inside had all the doors open no ac it was a really for a social area  we didnt have food only drinks so i cant comment on the food,2
i come here during lunch hours and love it friendly service and great food,4
decent place cool atmosphere,3
cute modern pastel lovefest looking placenni requested a sample of the carrot cake which was promptly handed over white gelato white spoon and a black curly hairnntruly a kodak moment,0
the peanut brittle is greatnnthe customer service sucks,2
good coffee  im not eating doughnuts or bagels at the moment so its hard to rate their signature foods ask me again in 40 pounds,2
i never thought id like poutine and i certainly dont want to eat it every day but this stuff was really good get it with some bacon or sausage on top excellent for teenage boys,3
one of the best poutines i have ever had was here luckily when i arrived there was hardly a line but the place was packed service was quick however our waitress didnt speak english to us which would be hard for tourists but it was fine with me,4
i am an absolute passionate about breakfast food and do they deliver their breakfast food is delicious as well as their poutines burgers and shepherds pie,4
pretty good poutine cheese curds were a bit too chewy but otherwise nice lots of flavor choices quite heavy definitely preferred comptoir 21 though,2
nice rooftop deck they dont have many beers but some different mix drinks made up for it,2
the crepes were too chewy and hard to cut with a knife the smoothies tasted like artificially sweetened tang and overall the price was way too much for what we ordered the only reason why this place gets 2 stars was because of the nice staff,1
enjoyed a wonderful lunch at bc today the food and service was wonderful my guest who had never been there before could not stop commenting on how great the place was its always a joy to introduce people to a hidden gem like this,4
delicious  friendly staff the baguette used for the sandwich was extremely soft and the potato soup was perfect for todays gloomy weather only downside was that the coffee was slightly acidicsour but thats only a preference will def be back for lunch soon,4
between the 3 of us we had sandwiches the chipotle the blue brie and the 3 cheese all very good but my favorite is the chipotle sandwich,4
great food at reasonable prices located right next to the sports book its casual  a great spot for lunch i had the burger which was enormous  one of the best burgers ive ever had we got a side of sweet potato fries that were definitely worth 6 nndefinitely recommend,3
service was okaynnfood portions were good for the price but the food itself sucked nthe chicken didnt taste like meat and the spicy eggplant wasnt spicy the fried rice was okay but didnt taste like much either nnskip this place,0
i love yogurtland in general especially there i love to grab frozen yogurt after my workout at lvac this place closes pretty late which is also a plus i enjoy this place i love the flavors they offer the employees and the overall look of the store clean,4
absolute disaster no style no shape nworst haircut ive ever got in my lifetime need to wear a hat to hide itndont even want to go to work or see pplnwill never go back,0
best banana pudding in charlotte  servers are friendly and southern food is very good  be sure to ask about the specials they often source these from kings farmers market  they are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding salad dressing etc,3
good priced but not the best if one is carb conscious,2
by far the best chocolate ganache and red velvet cupcake ive ever had  the cupcakes were moist and the icing wasnt tooooo sweet a perfect combination  the decoration is ultra cute this place may be the only reason i would stay at the palazzo again lol,4
chips and salsa were good but thats where it ended dry meat on my tacos my wife had a really bad salad chicken coated with sauce that was more like italian sauce than anything mexican,1
food is great service is awful bartender really couldnt handle the 8 people at the bar and he messed up mine and the two men next to me orders either way the food was great lots of tequila  ill be back  only because i love mexican,2
always great to be back its a lot like eating at a moroccan friends house with a kick ass personal chef,4
overpricedni dont recommend it first the music wasnt good the drinks were overly overpriced even by las vegas standards and the security is rude definitely this was a one time visit,1
whomp whompnnhaving been to other vegas clubs and clubs in la this club was boring nyes they have a dance floor tables an outdoor patio but why would i ever wait to get in here when i can go to a better club in vegas nnnot worth it,1
the club was ok music was not bad but there were 10 guys to every female    maybe cool place for couples,2
thank you todd alcatraz lock and key i had called over a dozen locksmiths and none of them could cut my keynnif you need a bentley rolls royce jag or other rare key made call todd,4
very knowledgable and professional unfortunate that their shutters are made in china would have liked to use them but couldnt overlook that,2
helpful staff small servings gelado okay,2
this store has the worst customer service had a question fitness equipment and no one helpd us this is not the first time matter of fact every time the only thing good about this store is its location and selection on clothes,0
lunch on the patio also amazing  cant wait for happy hour,3
simply amazing i have known the owners for awhile and they are so nice nthe sliders and hot dogs are so good the french fries are also amazing they offer a wide variety of toppings too the chicken fingers are also good everything here is delicious there is a great drink and snack selection too,4

paradise bakery is awesome i love the freshly tossed salads like their southwest cesar salad and a cold cup of their refreshing mango tea ndelicious the service is always fun and enthusiastic n i give them an a for sure,4
phone in your orders because theyre cooking your food to ordernnmy last year of undergrad i called in so many times the guy knew my voice when i changed my phone number he still recognized menni could eat a half dark meal every day,4
food  beverage are great but the service is horrendous been there several times  my only complaint is horrible service,1
this place is extremely good  it is the second best indian resturant in vegas  the first being namaste   it is not a hole in the wall just in an off strip location  this is where the locals eat,3
the burgers are tasty but theyre much more expensive than other fast food burger joints its definitely worth trying at least once if youre into burgers,2
went for dinner last night they have closed  dont know if its just a remodel or whether they are out of here,0
we went in at 7pm with a groupon got a lane right away and had a blastneveryone was very nice,4
this place is fast becoming my favorite ayce spot here in vegas  it has been more reliably good than any othernntasty appetizers especially the garlic chicken good quality fish and quick service make me want to keep coming back here,3
great selection freshess of fishgood but ive had better prices are average happy hour is great as far as their serviceslow and weak so they get 3 stars,2
wasnt overly impressed by lunch here sushi was ok but service was ok at best and they kept the place freezing cold ive had better wont likely return to this restaurant,1
this place sucks worst customer service ever then if youre with a group of friends you cant split the bill also they dont really close at the time listed on the door they close more than half hour before the closing time listed  servers are so rude too worst place ever,0
used to be my goto sushi joint for happy hour that is until i discovered soho theres nothing wrong with 808 its just that compared to soho theres no reason to go back to 808,2
hmmmmm really just not sure about this place at all went for a lunch and just wasnt impressed i had the quesadilla with carnitas which was ok we also got chicken wings and they were well awful cold greasy and just not very goodnnthe search for good texmex goes on,1
this place is the best they have a great selection of flavors that they change daily i thinknnplus its locally owned so thats good,3

not a normal steak but one of my favorites in pgh,4
the service is hit or miss but the food is almost always great the staff was all eating lunch at the same time one day when we came in they had to fight over who was going to get up to seat and serve us,2
carne asada is good here,2
since writing my initial review i have received several messages from the business owners accusing me of making false claims being a troll and making accusations that i wrote a bad review because i didnt like a post on facebook that they made it has been absolutely absurd,0
a bit pricey but very good pizza if you live in the upper stclairmt leboscottbridgeville area and you like fioris in dormont youll love this place as folinos bros pizza taste pretty similar to theirs,3

tori is the best eye brow threader i have ever gone to shes super sweet efficient and does an amazing job im always so happy when i go see her never again would i get my eyebrows waxed ever,4
the ice cream isnt that great and the workers look like theyre half dead no smile no thank you nothing the tangerine sorbet also tastes like chemical ice,0
darrens a dootiehead again i found nothing wrong with their pizza or wings,3
sorry to say but im not a fan after my first visit maybe i just ate on an off day but i dint enjoy the flavors as much when compared to say pita jungle and though the meat and vegetables were over done service was very friendly though so it wasnt all bad,1
oh how i wish i could leave 0 stars because this joint deserves it,0
very averageseafood was cold and not highest qualityfor this price it should be greatand our server was goofyand chauvanistic,2
ambiance plenty of seating  cozy was not crowded the 2 times i wentnnservice barista is a sweet polite young ladynncoffee chai latte is delicious perfectly sweet esp good with the white chocolate gingerbread biscotti gingerbread latte isnt as great,3

cute shop with an oldtimey feel to it the popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass casesnnunfortunatley it is not worth going out of your way for i had better popcorn at pnc parknnit would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes,2
nice theatre service was great food was good doors opened late staff at the door has major attitude how about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests,2
i dont know what everyones issue is dont be a mouthbreather have your package properly addressed with appropriate forms filled out and mail it if you cant handle that you should stay inside,2
great lunch place fresh well seasoned food has more than sushi  kimichi pork was tasty,3
full service hair salon with tanning beds   they do everything from the basic cut to color highlights brazilian blowouts extentions hair replacement and wigs  always offer coffetea or water while i am waiting for my highlights to set  no pressure for a rebook  check it out,4
ordered sesame chicken and it was way overcooked like it was sitting around and they recooked it half of the order was not edible and there was not very much meat on the pieces i did eat,0
this dunkin kinda sorta replaced the old one over on liberty avenue  good thing too cos that one was kind of a dump  nndunkins donuts are okay but face it  the only reason i ever come in here is to get the coffee  dunkin has bulk coffee and i actually like that better,1
this place is horrible donuts are always stale coffee always tastes burned staff is rude i never have a good experience here worst dunkin donuts i have ever been to,0
had a good experience here  tonya was extremely kind and professional  the owner sonny was nice and we felt very comfortable here  i would return,3

love this place we have taken our furry son here for the last 6 months and everytime he comes out awesome the staff is super friendly and always a joy to work with we even moved away from the area and continue to go back thanks again canine design kai came out lookin handsome today once again,4
the food was really good the service was terrible the waitress was acting like she didnt want to be there the least a server can do is refill your glass once you have drank all the water and have eaten all the ice she still got her 20 tip because of gratuity,2
a nice new store there are many in the north of the valley this one is the nicest out of the way so never busy all the great little shops inside and even a starbucks,3

great food the balls are great staff is nice the curry chicken was bomb was a nice treat from out of town the drinks are different too a,4
bomb food plain and simple the pretzel with fondue is sooooo yummy and i love the chicken and gorgonzola salad plus its central to old town walking distance from the clubs or the mall major bonus,3

amazing i tried their nutellabanananut crepe at the old town farmers market in scottsdale az and it was simply the best nutella crepe ive ever had keep it up,4
so i walked this bridge many times on my way back and fourth from the pirates game the bridge is closed during pirate games but has a safe walking area even when cars are allowed on  the bridge has beautiful views and on one end a guy selling 1 waters and pirate swag,4
clerks are great but supervisors and box services are flat out rude,0
terrible pharmacy  never on time  lack of responsiveness  no follow through,0
surprisingly really good i liked the nachos i got the most and it all tasted fresh and it was made relatively quick excellent service as well i had a hard time deciding but they were patient with me,3
really youre a mexican eating establishment and dont dont have fing limes   i dont care how expensive they get ridiculous,1
service was great food is very good as close to authentic as youll get in arizona,3
a blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for  not worth the 8 price tag  we should have gone across the street to subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it,1
one of thee best places to eat in madison for sure it can be a bit loud inside but who cares the food and drinks are so delicious the upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious support this bar it is so worth it,4
met some friends here after work  while mabels is more of a late night place we still had funnnthe swedish meatballs lollipop chicken and pork belly appetizers were all goodnnthe old fashioned cocktail is a winnernni love the dark cluby atmosphere and cool music,3
about as pretentious as it gets in scottsdale dark and noisy expensive drinks not really my kinda a place but if youre into that kind of thing,2
just average food with exception of the chicken lollipops cool ambiance and good service,2
closed,1
they should put the flies on the menu we went for lunch and were bothered by so many flies that it ruined the meal just be prepared,1
the downtown location food is hit or miss i dont know if it depends on who is cooking or what is happening when you go on a good night the food is excelent otherwise its just ok this location does consistenly have poor service though especially on the patio,1
good food mediocre service but decent priced happy hour food and drinks love the jalapeno cilantro hummus more than anything totally craveable,2
despite really knowing their stuff when it comes to mediterranean food killer falafel and baba ganoush i now also think of them for great thin crust pizza  the atmosphere is super cool too  try sitting outside at night,4
food is good loved the jerked chicken but the service is bad bad bad  i have been to ob four times  the first time the cook waited on us and the service was great  the next three times not so good  the feeling that they give is that they could care less that you came in or if you come back,0
the two times i went in there the customer service was horrible and would not go back for that reason,1
very nice brew pub to compliment the madison beer scene all the tastings in the beer flight were good the food menu is also quite good worth a return visit,3
huge projector,4
went on a night that they had a live band on the patiowas a nice atmosphere drinks were good but food was just okay may go back if other places are too busy,2
entire rental experience was a complete disaster rent somewhere else,0
this business is now in the process of going out of business  this is what happens to businesses in this city who voice objections to their customers who are lgbt or polyamorous  bigotry is not welcome in madison,0
would not recommend this place  the management is arrogant and the food is mediocre  we have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 1520 following the crazy legs run in madison  everyone in our group 15 agreed to look for a different venue for next years event,0
they do serve alcohol they have a full bar,4
salsa bar alone is worth it  awesome artwork is worth it  best tacosburritos are the cactus ones  not overpriced  we love this place,3
good local sub shop,2
must try the beef skewersnndipped in peanut sauce ridiculously goodnsalads were good herenother items were just okay  pad thai fried ricendidnt like the drunken noodlesnnprices cheap during lunch special time not crowded,3
i had their man vs food special and it was great they give you a ton of food for about 15nnthe chicken was soft and juicy on the inside while crunchy on the outside the chipotle ranch takes the whole thing to a completely different levelnni will try to eat here everytime i visit vegas,3
hated it even after a 45 min wait for a table we had to wait an hour for the food this is no joke and it wasnt just us it happened to this is the norm food not so great  it was equivalent to dennys sorry but thats the truth,1
great food service sucks,2
good food but easily enough to split  loved the basil and cheese eggs good potatoes  the portions are gigantic and for your hearts sake i would advise splitting a meal so come hungry,2
the portion sizes and the food was amazing  i love this place,4
the best meal i ate in vegas  i shared the chicken benedict  it was soooooo good come hungry  i will go back next time i go to vegas,4
food here was surprisingly better then the hash house on sahara i figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here  service on the other hand was not as good as the one on sahara so i guess thats the trade off lol,3
food and service was great definitely bring your appetite highly recommend the sage fried chicken  waffles they beat roscoes hands down as busy as it was our server was very attentive expect to take a togo box out the door will come back for sure,4
horrible enough said and they have the nerve to sale chicken and waffles if i was the food police they would be banded from making horrible chicken and waffles,0
great experience here with the food and service our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish when they say the portions are huge its an understatement the food was tasty and the service was friendly really glad i was able to try it,3
everything was awsome i got the famous chicken and waffles with a bloody mary i was so stuffed after half of this giant portion but i just couldnt stop eating and forced myself to keep going prices were reasonable compared to most places around i will return and would recommend to anyone,4
awesome i will be returning,4
huge portions great food  its 24 hours i wish there was one these in los angeles only downside is that its always busy here waiting list is long so make sure you have patience it will pay off once you have your food best believe that,4
huge portions  great food and ambiance,3
had the sage fried chicken benedict and it was very good but the service was flat out horrible  40 minutes to get our food and the beer that i ordered when i sat down  the place wasnt all that busy either,1
i am sorry to say but i did like jesse and urias but they decided to diss me after requesting service  they scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up no call i tried to call them to reschedule but they did not return my phone call its a shame because i liked them,0
dj is playing good music from mix house to hiphop and to some 80s rock their drinks are strong and their bartender brings such joys to the crowd some are celebrating their birthdays here or just celebrating their way of being happy its never a problem to get drinks its the happiest place on earth,3
this used to be my favorite spot in old townand then suede closedand now it can only be described in one word ghetto,0
one of the lessbad clubs in the area its a little more loungelike and chill i suggest visiting with a group and to prearrange seating,2
hands down the best mexican restaurant i have found in charlotte  the food is consistently good the prices are reasonable and the service is good  you should give it a try  you wont be disappointed,3
bottom line mexican food for white people too scared to go to a taqueria  every entree is 2 dollars more than it should be  but that said the flavors were fine  salsas were nice and smokey,2
good meal but the entrees including the stuffed roasted rabbit loin i got were barely lukewarm on arrival way too loud  on a monday at 800  to hold a conversation out of the wine we ordered solid service nice presentation,2
im not from this area so when i come around phoenix i always have to stop at a jersey mikes since there are very few in so cal  i cant wait till they open more where i live cause you can tell the quality is unmatched compared to subway and quiznos,3
great tacos,3
i am a fan of culvers but this location is not as awesome as the ones in minneapolis and wisconsin  however good service nonetheless excellent burgers and mmm culvers frozen custard  it just cant be beat,3
was that a burger i was so turned off by the charred greasy whatever that was on my buni couldnt take a second bite or even make myself eat the fries or order any custard so based on the one bite i could stomach less than 1star,0
this place was clean and the service was top notch it is a cross between a dairy queen and a carls jr if you are hungry  get your hamburger with 2 patties  they are kinda slim the fries were great and they have a ton of frozen custard desserts,2
the burgers are fantastic the staff could be a bit more pleasant but the food is so yummy that im willing to overlook their indifference,2
find it greasy but my boys love it,2
i just completed a trade in for a new watch i couldnt have asked for better service or better value if youre looking for a new watch this is the place,4
i go here every year for my birthday its amazing i first tried fondue in switzerland and this place is better bring your appetite and save room for the chocolate fondue portion pricey but worth it,4
the thing that really stands out about momoyama was the service i enjoy the fact that i can go into the restaurant after a few weeks and the waitress knows what i want to drink  great service goes a long way for mennthe food is pretty good it is all you can eat i will go here again and again,3
chicken fingers were good the ribeye was good nice portions clean bathroom attentive staff not extra smoky open 24 hours small yet varied menu will probably be on our late night munchies list,1

pizza quality never disappoints  however servers need to tie their hair back same memory of the location by mill avenue  basic hygiene please,0
pros  inexpensive large portions the cheese puffs or crab ragoon as we call them at home were awesome if i go back thats the only thing ill order  these rice was not ediblenncons  food was soso just average  it was quick and easy,1

you can see instruments from all over the world and actually hear the music played on them via headphones  the teens were especially interested in the instruments owned by elvis john lennon and eric clapton  we were there for 2 hours  it was 36 for all of us and well worth it,4

are you lost run away from this place as fast as you can not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food at 35 45 with taxes and tips the holidays menu is a total ripoff,0
honestly who knew the flying biscuit had booze  awesome what a bonus the grits at flying biscuit are fantastic they are creamy dreamy delciousness perfectly salted and loaded with fat what more could a girl ask for a great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too,3
what a menu so many things to choose from the open face turkey sandwich was delicious it was just like eating a homemade thanksgiving dinner clam chowder was also greatnmy son has the cheesy cheese burger and fresh cut fries which he said was yummynwell be back,3
its not made with carenthe foodnthe cooks dont know what they are doing its american food not mexican,1
not impressed the service was very intermittent was not told upfront that they were out of certain ingredientsno pulled pork no chili and after placing an order for breaded chicken was later told they were out of that too no utensils were brought to the table waitress was mia nearly the entire time,1
we ate here because of convenience and location we were at the lake hungry and not ready to go home yet they have an okay menu selection but i would never go out of my way to go back,1
i went for breakfast with a friend  yum  i had the most delicous breakfast burrito  the potatoes are as yummy as they come  we used an entertainment coupon for buy one get one but it would have been cheap even without it  i cant wait to go back,3
great price duh and they are super fast ive never waited longer than 5 minutes to get in and grab some food nice folks behind the counter too,4
i most certainly love five guys burgers  fries dude even their hot dogs rock,3
always have to get the pollo fundido  cant go wrong with that  its even better on wednesdays  5,3
horrible salsa and awful stale chips mediocre fish tacos and they dont have black beans seriously,1
this was a fun event in a gorgeous location you have to get there early because they run out of many of the beers fast as long as the weathers nice i wont miss this event,4
are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault and the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special i dont think i would have a reason to go back,1
bland food bad service prepare to wait for an hour for your main course,0
i love their sauce and will gladly trade fries and bread for extra sauce non our most recent visit employee kenton was so patient and professional in explaining how we could get the most chicken for our   little things like that is what will keep me a loyal customer,3
really really good  just moved to east vegas wanted a good restaurant  found one   had crab cheese rangoons delish chicken satay fabulous chicken yellow curry perfect taste  after taste spicy mint pork with,4
ambience great coffee ok service below par thats me in there now 3 times this past week and not a smile or hello from anyone working there one more try and then im moving on if no change,1
quirky interior clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in townnnn could maybe do with opening past 1800,2
the food aint what it used to be here theyve introduced a carvery but only one visit per person,1
i left my expensive raybans on the table after eating at binions cafe when i returned 10 minutes later for the sun glasses they werent there and the waiter that served us was not to be seen very disappointing,0
prices are good and portions are great i almost couldnt finish all my food ive been here for breakfast and dinner and was satisfied with both my visits the staff was very friendly and you dont have to wait very long for your food will most likely return in the future,3
equipment is not well maintained pads are wearing out and not replaced on a fair amount of the machines  no attention to oiling machines  place is not especially clean  not enough lockers   cardio cinema is a complete waste of space,0
every time i have grabbed a snack at this place they have messed up my order and it tasted horrible anyhownnthey also take forever to complete your order it does not take 20 minutes to make a quesadilla sorrynnnever going here again,1

probably one of the coolest bars in madison quirky without being pretentious laid back without being soporific fantastic beer selection and really friendly staff,4
this place is very clean and has a friendly staff our favorite was the sisig too bad they took it off the menu their sinigang and lechon kawali are delicious,3
visited last week and was very happy it took a few minutes longer than expected but it was well worth the wait will return next time in town,3
good average food not the greatest but it hits the spot 808 hawaii mixed plate up the road has some fancier dishes a little more tasty but you get what you expect here,1
tried the short ribs by far the worst short ribs ive ever had it had no taste and it was gamey,0
i thought that i could only get some good noodles here on the east coast but boy was i wrong i cant stop thinking about how good it was next time i am in town im heading straight there,3
everytime i come to the phoenix area i make a stop in here for a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with traditional toppings and some gyoza some of the better ramen ive had since leaving las vegas if you see the sign and think cup ramen you are dead wrong after this you will never go back to instant,3
meh ive had better not very authentic and the broth was mediocre i asked for the tonkatsu spicy and they seasoned it way too spicy not to mention the charsiu tasted very old still on the hunt for a real ramen noodle house in the valley  very disappointing,1
horrible ngo to burger king insteadis that bad,0
this walmart was just like any other walmart except the employees were extremely rude and not helpful at all i will no longer be going to this walmart i will drive the extra miles to another walmart for the smiles and friendly help,0
fries are great but everything else is terrible  i would eat here more often if they improved their burgers even just a little bit,2
fries where not good at all kind of mushy and weird seasoning they charge for ranch the burger was nothing to brag about i had to ask for ketchup coupon made it worth a try tricky parking lot to pull our of to make a left hand turn,1
gimmick  they say no enrollment fee but they want 69 admin fee  whatever the other lifetime fitness is only 69 enrollment nbullshit,0
ive been going here since september of last year and i still love it i have an awesome trainer who helps and educates his class it may be a bit pricey but to me its worth it,3
cute place in an authentic setting the restaurant has scottish charm the food was clean and hearty had a halibut carpaccio which was amazing the staff was friendly met the owner who was just great highly recommend,4
not happy got there at open to get a meatball sub i hope i got yesterdays marinara sauce i hope they would not serve that crap  it was horrible  if thats you standard change it i wasted my money and will not be back,0
not a bad little place at all i can only add one more little tip yelpers if you have a mac youre going to have a problem getting onto the network nmy friend jack and the lady sitting across from us had the same problem they couldnt connectnnshould have bought a pc fools,3

second trip to downtown tattoo  buddy hooked us up and fixed our tats super guy who stands by his shop and the people he has working there nnhappy to say the next time were back in vegas this is the only place we will get our tattoos,4
hmmm  actually i forget about this room  loved the ballys casino its got a good feel like the clubs here too  but the room  forgetable  this is the old mgm grand where the fire happened kinda cool if you dig vegas history,2
our south tower room had great view of the strip and casino isnt so large that you get lost room was a bit tired and there are newer cheaper options not bad,2
writing about the poker table the dealers here are rude and sometimes split the pot wrong for example it was headsup and me and the other guy had ace king when the pot was split he got an extra 5 chip and i got a white 1 chip when i corrected him he said the next hand was dealt little ass,0
what a horrible place to staydo not stay herefurniture beat up in newly remodeled roomswhole place stinks like cigsfire hazards in roomnot up to codemusic from outside hotel blasting till three in the morningpoor servicebad attitude from managementto much to list just stay away,0

honest reliable caring nhands down this is the only place i come to when i need automotive replacements and repairs i just changed by spark plugs and tightened my belt great service with great prices recommend hondoctors,4
coffee roasted on site  sunday afternoons good coffee usually quiet atmosphere very nice staff sanwiches are a bit over priced but taste good focus on the coffee and you will do well have gotten alot of work done here and have held many meetings outside,3
when i have needed to be in the las vegas strip area and yet didnt care to pay the lv strip surcharge i discovered and stayed here ever so slightly just off lv stripnnthere is a pool and free wifi with your roomnnfood just around the cornernparking included completely with their parking lot,2
i love bosa and to be honest i prefer them over dunkin donuts friendly staff and delliiicciooousss donuts and cheap too  their breakfast food items are really good too i recommend this place for donuts over dunkin any day if the week,4
i literally hate this place because their donut holes are so delicious and addicting i moved into an apartment down the street and now i have to drive by it everyday haunting my dreams with delicious donuts,4
i love this place but always seem to forget about it the rockin shrimp is an absolute must the slider app actually makes a nice meal for the ladies i love the salmon and my husband loves the chimichurri  skirt steak their happy hour is one of the best around,3
everything was fine just surprised anyhow old of movies they were still playing some had been in theaters 34 months seems to be the jr high hangout place,2
its 1016 am they just opened the check out lines are long elderly people scrambling to find a place to stand in a busy unorganized costco mess seriously management must awaken to a better effective way to care for their patrons,0
we were told a one hour wait  with no one in the waiting area and the hostess was incredibly rude and unhelpful such a disappointment,0
edinburghs most accomplished restaurant  food and wine pairings are excellent and the service sublime  the dining room is beautifully appointed and extremely intimate  for the most special of occasions in edinburgh this is definitely the place,4
i couldnt have imagined that this place could get any worsei was wrongnni left city the other night knowing it was a mere 5 minute walk to my flat and knowing i was totally safeuntil i opened my bag and found a bit of paper saying nnhey baby youre sexy call me on 07921nncmon seriously,0
busy place with a long waitnnfood was mediocrennbut their margaritas were super good id come back just for those,2
im torn on this place fries good inferno wings awesome pulled pork mushy and the flavor wasnt very good it had the consistency of dog food ulcerator may have been better had the hamburger not been raw service was ok nobody in our group was very impressed eith the experience,1
very good food  very fresh for chinese food  the shrimp fried rice was very fresh  great service  they had high chairs for my 1 year old and were very nice about the mess she made,3
overall  good buffet selection  went there on valentines day craving for some seafood buffet  they served complimentary champagne and unlimited lobster claws that night the line was long but it was  worth the wait  asian dishes could be improved i think,3
we went for mothers day buffet and menu sounded great prime rib had no taste shrimp was mushy food was cold crab legs also mushy and no taste overall this is the worst mothers day buffet we have been to also a party of six was charged 20 tip without telling me prior to charging,1
is the food good yesnnhowever youll have a nicer dining experience at a fast food place we arrived at 630 and were out the door by 702 and not by choice,2
my wife and i really enjoy going to this carvel  schlotskys restaurant  they have really delicious sourdough crust pizzas i love the bbqchicken  jalapeu00f1o and tasty icecream treats   freewifi and cold raspberry lemonade help make it a great place to go,3
the service sucked managers were outside on break or smoking when the restaurant was packed always out of something on the menu like taquitos i like el pollo loco food and will have to drive further to get better food and service then this location,0
the pizza is so good that i forgive them for being red sox fans and will continue to eat there despite all the red sox posters so if a new yorker can tolerate red sox paraphernalia the pizza has to be good,4
loved the pizza  loved the service  what more do you want,3
service and ambiance were 5 star food was 2 star had the linguini portifino and it was just soso seafood was bland and tough i hate to leave a review like this but it is what it is the bread and wine selection was great though,2
love this place amazing home decor i finally found the shelf that i needed for my kitchen and they have tons of cute decorations to make your house a home very unique,4
busy atmosphere and can be a bit of a wait food is decent enough and the price ok ni did find the most memorable thing about big in japan was the service,2
i come here once a week food is always good usually i have miso ramen or the lunch special tina tataki i think the tataki is best in town if there is anywhere else with a betyer tataki i have not had itnnservice can be an issue so come when its not busy also thwir late nite option is great,4

worthy,4
very delicious food here,4
this place makes the best latte ive ever had i miss it so much after i graduated hoticed latte macchiato berry tart sfogliatelle are my favorite,4
lots of fun it is not as scary as you would imagine i am the biggest wimp and it was a piece of cake it is kind of spendy for the 3 second fall but worth it if you just want to say i jumped off the stratosphere,3
this cart features local and organic fare  the pasture raised pork carnitas are fantastic  hands down the best food cart around charlotte,3

pizza is good  got the pasta and it was bland not thrilled with the salad either,1
good atmosphere food is very good and i would give 4 stars but service was slow tonto arrive at our table and we waited nearly 45 minutes for a burger staff is very pleasant,2

best burger ever homemade bun so soft and somewhat like hawaiian bread truffle fries are amazing,4
my hubby and i love the kiki burger,4
i wasnt impressed  the oxtail chili cheese fries was very good but the miyagisans grass fed wagyu burger and ronin burger were not  both burgers were relatively tasteless and whatever taste was there was interestingnnit is definitely not worth a taxi ride from the strip,1
went last night keep in mind ive been here dozens of times  our server didnt give a hoot about our table of five we ordered the pickles and they were slimy asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like hi umnooooo you lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky manager,0
i love the food here the oxtail fries is a must and the 26 shogun burger was worth every bite,4
good food great old school hip hop high ass pricesdefinitely different items like ox tail fries  different,2
boba tea thats all i visit this place for i cant get enough of the milk teas  smoothies with boba,3
eh pizza is alright not a crazy fan of but it could also be because they took an hour to deliver when we are 5 mins away,1
portions are less and the prices are substantially more  nnlove the food and the atmosphere but with the rising costs my visits become less frequent,2
out of all the korean food that i have tasted so far soyo has the best their bulgogi is the best i love their atmosphere as well the people are extremely friendly and the pricing is not the bad this place is definitely five stars,4
fantastic food eat there frequently very good service my wife and i enjoy soyo evdrytime we go,4
slow internet connection no coffee available downstairs constantly out breakfast was gross room was clean so that was a plus but as a business traveler coffee and internet are foundation,2
ive been going to this office for about 2 years now and each experience ive had has been a positive one the staff is fabulous and ive never had a problem getting in for an appointment when its time for my checkup,3
i love couture clips  what a wonderful groomer  i have 2 shih tzus and she did an amazing job  ive been looking for a great mobile groomer for a long time and i finally found one,4

great food and fast service loved the chicken fried noodles,3
i love this place the noodles are hand made great prices large portions super quick and friendly staff,4
a well deserved 5 star restaurant cheap and authentic fresh pulled noodles everyday fast service lots of space and clean environment,4
this place is amazing generous portions and a great price service is okay not the best but i def keep coming back because of the food,4
had the cold pig ears pork noodle dish and pan fried dumplings  meh it was okay but not worth going back,1
probably one of the best steaks in las vegas comfortable seating and busy very busy lobster appetizer was a bit pricey for the little but delicious amount you got for a new restuarant the staff was very well trained looking forward to next visit minus lobster app,3
hostess are lame when it comes to seating so just tell them were you would like to sit before you get moving to your table every server i have had here has been awesome and they dont card you if you come with a middle aged man with a black amex d,2
check in on yelp and get 20 of services,3
i have been back here a few more times when mimi is not available i have seen a few other techs all of them are very friendly and i leave happy every time love this spot thanks guys,4
i feel that this is one of the healthier choices for frozen yogurt  the location is convenient although parking can be very tight  the price per ounce has significantly increased lately which is why i give it 3 stars,2
i have a spicy chicken mayo and pineapple baguette once a day youd think it would really work but it does nps my brother says their sweet chilli chicken panini rocks his balls,4
this was the worst restaurant i have ever been to service was atrocious and food was bland on my enchiladas they didnt even use real cheese waited over 20 minutes to get silverware and a drink refill,0
the band was awesome even though they started late i thought the cover charge was a little excessive for whats basically a sports bar the food was okay our server was incredibly rude after we switched from booze to soda nbut the vibe was fun the band was fun and we had a good time,2
i have taken my pup buena here many times for both doggie day care and boarding over the weekend  the ownersstaff are always happy to see us and always take good care of buena  best part is she comes home totally exhausted,4
nothing special  had their basic burger w friessweet potato fries  it wasnt bad but nothing makes me really want to go back if youre in scottsdale try indulge burger instead,2
absolute worst service ever been here for 1 12 hours and still no food manager ignored 3 requests to talk to us and when he finally came to our table he had an attitude waitress was non existent dont come here if you want to eat anytime soon,0
good but weak drinks and typical bar food still a decent place to grab some grub before a show at comedy zone,2
waited to be seated no one seated us we sat down at one of many empty tables five minutes later a fellow told us all the table were reserved this place was only 25 full at most so we left walked by in a bit after eating elsewhere and it was still mostly empty guess they didnt want our money,0
food was okay it earned the 2 stars the wait staff is horrible had to ask for silverware had to ask for napkins and i had to walk up my cup for a refill,1
great service  good food great naan,3
delicious not heavy or greasy perfect spice great service we had it for take out and will definitely return yumm,4
this is a good restaurant for quick chinese today the kids were rather disappointed because the orange chicken was cold and didnt have much sauce we come here often and this was a rather lackluster visit i hope it will be better next time,1
the best burger i have had in las vegas,4
weve ordered cupcakes from treehouse on two occassions  weve had lemon blueberry vanilla chocolate and churro  all were wonderful  the mini cupcakes are the perfect bite  highly recommend,4
so i usually love coming in here and grabbing a smoothie togo but today i decide to have something to eat i waited for an hr for my food if i knew it was going to take this long i would of never ordered anything to eat i doubt i would have mind if i came in here with someone but i just got off work,1
spicy tuna roll is pretty good big pieces of tuna not the usual mayo mix nice sushi chefs good happy hour prices not a large sushi selection though  they did tell me they were in the process of expanding it,2
this place is bomb love kimchi fried rice  4 skewers heaven,4
subway needs to watch its back comparable prices better quality and outstanding selection put which wich ahead of the game and might i recommend the wicked,3
fun and silly place to spend a couple of hours learned more about mustard than i needed to or ever thought i would especially great on a cold and wet day,4
simpsons arcade gamenprop cyclenmusic gamesnwhat more do you want from themnshut up and give them your money,4
love chickfila been a raving fan for almost 6 years when it comes to customer service and atmosphere it just doesnt get any better than chickfila its more than just a transaction its an experience great family environment and healthy choices,4
too bad theyre closed on sunday definitely better than mcdonalds i love this place,3
need fat need carbs come here i usually get a steak grinder or sub i guess and jalapeno poppers they do the steak just how it is at home the east coast i trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break they also have good fried fish,3
kind of like a one night stand quick dirty cheap and you feel like crap in the morning,1
thought the idea of driving to phoenix to go check out an aquarium sounded cool but no way jose way way overpriced cool tanks but  too small fake coral and over all small got through the whole thing in 45 minutes dont waste your money buy a dvd on sea life and you will do much better,0
this place always has a long ass line i dont understand it i wish they could improve their service somehow,1
the place has a cool atmosphere and people are generally nice but beware of the incredibly slippy tile floors  not even kidding also the area with the dj is far too small so dont expect to stay on the dance floor unless you want to feel like a sardine,2
had a great time with friends here a couple months ago  im headed back to vegas in 2 weeks if we run out of ideas for things to do well be sure to hit this place up again,4
every drink is overpricednemployee are very mean and rude the waitress spilled drink on me and after she yelled at me and told me to get out from the club because she works there i will never ever come back to that evel place,0
ah ihopthis is a regular stopping place for us on a saturdaysunday morning before hitting the movie theatre at norterranthe food is generally good our son loves the pancakes here and i am a big fan of the crepes nthe service is typically good but can be a little slow,4
great food and great service,3
favorite indian food in az the staff is friendly my father is a regular and they know him by name buffet is so good and it tastes so flavorful the naan is also very good and my favorite,3
if you want original indian food this is the place it might seem a little weird in the beginning but this place is amazing i love the buffet but specially the vegetarian food is delicious best place in town with their amazing mango like ice cream,4
really delicious ive been looking for some indian food for awhile and decided to try this place out definitely going to have to become a regular i got the chicken tikka masala and it was the best ive had as well as the naan which was also excellent a must go for sure,4
review pending,0
i have never been to one of these chains before  so stopped in for lunch to pick up a salad to go  a plethora of options for salads which is the point of a salad buffet  decent price and it was super clean always important,3
ive been here twice and had a brilliant time on both occasions i would recommend a day bed great venue great music great weather great staff the best day party in vegas,4
best pool party in vegas hands down back in the day rehab was the spot now this is the go to great crowd great djs,4
its a record store one of the only in las vegas nif i ever pair for media il likely buy it here,2
this review is for the sunday market on easternnvery limited selection at very high prices mostly the left overs from the first 2 daysnthought i would try it again but it was just the samenyou can save 50 by shopping at the district at green valleys farmers marketnon thursday evening,1
service was great staff was very polite and we were seen right away my daughter seen dr hill who was very kind and made her laugh would recommend,4
the philly sandwich on a 50 cent hotdog bun was 15 and not good at best i would recommend moving on for the next place if you need lunch and its not a fast stop to boot,0
such an awesome show so much fun to be had the music is great the dancing is outstanding and the comedy is top rate,4
dont waste your money on this the show is boring and has not real dance move like they had on americas best dance crew total money wasted,1
not bad but not that good we expected it was ok compare to chris angle show this one was better,1
the crystal veg is a great roll can be pretty loud but very good sushi love the little cave like booths in the back great for 4 people,3
terrible went there for lunchnsushi had only rise i had a hard time finding or tasting the fish rise was undercooked wasted my time and money i suggest you try new zealand although their location is not as prime,0
great sushi  great service great atmosphere they have real nice private seating that you should try out for date night n   also  the 100best shrimp sauce,4
im definitely a fan of the groves  you can bring your dog and relax outside  a main reason i go is to see the server levi  he is so friendly and funny  he makes you feel like you are visiting his home and you have been friends forever  i recommend the buffalo chicken salad,3
very good food and service high recommend the prime rib sandwich the best i have ever tasted,3
loved the atmosphere excellent music very cool patrons and staff  the seaweed salad was excellent,4
nice placewe usually eat at the sushi bar  great sushiwe come here quite a bit and have always had great service the regular bar area is always crowded  a big happy hour crowd  love this place,3
o boy i just discovered rocket burgers subs totally awesome this is the first time in a long while i drank 7up from a bottletha fries are the bomb too,4
wendys is wendys one of my favorites if i am forced to eat fast food they were out of breakfast burritos kinda upsetting because it was early in the morning i was surprised by how good the sausage was ok the biscuit,2
the receptionist is rude about a minute after i checked in another client came in and was offered water or coffee seems like she picks and chooses who to be friendly to,0
yep it appears closed for good,0
food is always great but the service was horrible  we sat outside because the weather was perfect but it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table there was people sitting all around us but we were just ignored next time i want chompies i will be going to location in tempe,1
the waitress we had here was horrible  the bus boy gave us more attention than she did  i say give him her job  the food was ok nothing spectacular a little over priced but you are paying for the ambiance i guess,1
great bagels amazing pickles and decent prices the staff here is always friendly the bakery has a huge selection for treats to take home i love chompies for breakfast try one of their eggs benedict plates you wont be disappointed,3
good selction of beer but the service was blah  food was not great but sort of expect if from a more bar setting  someone put a lot of money into the place but they should care a bit more about what they put out now,1
hipstertrendy i think not  very disappointingweird crowd  older men on the prowl   and unfriendly bartenders w lots of attitude ive given this a few tries thinking i just hit it on a bad night  but wont be going back so many other great places in scottsdale to visit,0
we got to enjoy crispy buckwheat crepes and light salad for lunch here the wait staff brings a credit card machine to you and you can swipe and enter in the amount for tips right at your table there are small gift options or dessertsonthego you can browse in the store,3
pizza dough was good but everything else was way too salty do they ever taste it before they serve foods,0
the yogurt is very creamy and good but theyre slacking on the toppings compared to zoyo but i mainly gave orange leaf a lower rating because the staff are not friendly i sometimes go just because its close and its a little cheaper than the other froyo joints,2
i bought a pair of shoes there they gave me the right shoe the correct size and the left one is a size smaller they refuse to exchange them or give me the correct size because it was a final sale its my fault the shoes are different sizes,0
neighborhood snow cone shack   it can be a long wait but well worth the it,3
hands down best yogurt in all of lv and i assure you ive been to all of them the pumpkin pie flavor is bomb,4
best yogurt ive ever tasted wonderful consistency not watered down clean toppings bar and a good selection at that i hope they keep it up and the pumpkin pie flavor is delish,3
visited this place after buying a new phone at sprintnnwhen i go into a fro yo i only look for two flavors red velvet  peanut butternnthey didnt have either so i leftnnsorry im bias but its my review so i can be,1
place is alright but clearly it does not have the character if the rest of the southside   i am a fan of hofbrauhaus and claddahs in here though  shopping is tired and the movie theatre is so so,2
long drive thru line gingerbread latte tasted so watery i thought they gave me tea the caramel brulee latte was so strong tasted more like black coffee,0

nice atmosphere but food was average at best took the sever 20 minutes to bring coffee when she finally did it was with milk that curdledi had the western omelette that left much to be desired great place to people watch but consider eating elsewhere if youre looking for good service,1

we walked in on a sunday morning were seated immediately the wait staff were excellent as was the food  we had 2 more join us and the waiter pulled over another tableno problem  some of the best service i have had in recent years in vegassweet,4
and by one star mean no stars  mediocre ice cream its cold and icy but lacks in creamy deliciousness the bottled water is simply tap water in a reused bottle total rip off,0
sugar factory had a great ambience the server was really friendly funny and invited us back for breakfast my boys and i all had steaks before a night out i had the filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and to my delight was tender and flavorful definitely worth trying at least once,3
great customer service by knowledgable friendly staff not true cheapest place in town but you get what you pay for highly quality tint and great service worth every penny money well spent i highly recommend them,4
this is probably the best coffee shop in summerlin its a bit pricey but the drinks are solid and the macaroons are to die for,3
since sambalatte opened its doors in summerlin i became a huge fan i love their nutella latte and the variety of tea selections they have this place makes you feel as if you were not even in las vegas a great escapeawesome lattesall at sambalatte goodbye starbucks,4
i decided to give this place another try it was a mistake they were selling expired baked goods out of their fridge case service was average my friend complained that her latte was all milk and no espresso and the bottom of her croissant was visibly burned,1
i love this place havent had anything yet that i didnt like service is always outstanding and the prices are very reasonable its my go to for chinese in fact when my parents visit its their request on where to eat lol,4
if you like richardsons you should go there because this place is a cheap knockoff  the decor is tacky and the carne adasada has no flavor the bacon wrapped shrimp were dry and charred like a spent ember  two stars because the waitress was at least friendly,1
if youre expecting quality food prepare to be disappointed  even more disappointing was the obnoxious drunk owner who incredibly used the n word while talking to us  unbelievable,0
very clean tanning salon  they keep the towels in the back so dont forget to grab one before you start your session  friendly employees and great standup bedsnever a wait,4
great decor professional dealers and lots of celebrity poker players here  definitely worth checking out,4
by far one of the top 5 poker rooms in las vegas plenty of tables good action and good overall room my go to spot,4

food is really good but incredibly noisy  couldnt hear person next to me at our 4 top,2
the mac and cheese and the ginger gin drink was great my wife didnt like whatever chicken dish she ordered but well be back,3

long overdue review nnkimchi fried rice is a must anything with the kimchi is goodnnwe ordered a couple of other dishes like the kimchi burrito nachos fish tacos sandwiches theyre just ok nnthe place is small service is quick with a smile since all the food is made to order prepare to wait a bit,3
i expected really amazing mexican food in the southwest but ive only been disappointed the food at robertos is heavy and greasy there was runny sour cream poured on everything and it was outrageously salty i tried it once and i havent gone back,0
great local bike and snowsports shopthey have everything you need to get on the road or the slopes and they have a incredible selection of trek and cannon sale bike and many kinda of boards and bindings   the service center is also very knowledgable and reliable,4
this place is the bomb  food portions are huge and the quality is consistent recommend the mixed plate or katsuteri beef combo with mac salad  i wonder sometimes if the owner is a local or just bought the franchise but so far food is good representation of what you get in hawaii,3
nice neighborhood we spent the day here with our dogs and 4 year old had no issues with either park we will be frequent visitors,4
their beer selection was super but pricey  i got a yuengling and it cost 475  hmm  the service was pretty good and the food was alright it just seemed a little overpriced,2
great selection of beer plenty of it the food is soso typical barfood very nice waitstaff and bar tenders large enough place to accommodate a busy night worth the stop,2
they make mulled wine on demand just ask yes even after christmas is overnthat sums up how great the service is and the atmosphere or menu wont leave you disappointed either,4
this company closed their locations and didnt even update their  page about the closure  yelp is an untrusted source because the information of this closure is on the internet yet they still advertise as though it is a viable listing  shame on yelp,0
when im in the mood for a good hotdog this is the place to go always friendly staff and consistently great food slightly expensive for what it is but totally worth it thanks lukes,3
cupcakes can sometimes be a little dry and if you have a serious sweet tooth you can handle all the frosting  i usually throw away at least half of the frosting  i feel bad because its such a waste  i have gone about three times and each time i tried a different flavor  the variety is great,2
love it  i can share because of larger portion  good meatgood everything,3
they have a grill for those steaks that u are craving for typical ham and roast beef it was good for the price and for my boys who are at that age they cant stop eating,2
the last time i was there they had the nerve to want to charge me for a togo water for 99 cent f this place i just got done dishing out 850 for lunch then that was the icing on the cake,0
was ok nice place and clean and yes everyone speaks english lol but didnt get the full pedi experience no foot massage  no exfoliation  no scrubbing the feet  which is the main reason i go didnt even get lotions up but everyone was nice and accommodating,1
food was great service was pretty good over all great time,3
this place is great for drinks and nachos  the bbq chicken nachos i have had there the past two times have been amazing  nnthe overall menu is basic to boring and the staff seems preoccupied and dull  but when you are there to hang out for a couple hours and have beers it isnt a huge issue,2
for nearly 8 for a turkey club i was severely dissapointed when the bread ended up being stale and hard and you could totally tell that the cheese was the cheap processed american slices type walking in it seems like they sacrificed quality food for a showy appearance,1
i used to love it now their tea is watered down and no taste their sandwiches are of lesser quality and they no longer have the things they need to make it the have run out of supplys like no more boba no more chicken just annoying,0
ok for a quick breakfast no one can mess up a nova lox sandwich bottomless drinks are a plus,2
wasnt to impressed with there bacon  cheddar sandwich the bacon was coldeggs were mediocrecheese tastes nasty i asked them to toast itthey didnt it tasted like they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds the only thing that was good was the asiago bagel,2
great noncorporate bowling alley good lanes cheap beer decent eats at the oaxaca restaurant very reasonable prices cosmic bowling on the weekend happy hour with buck and a half pbrs during the week a sunnyslope landmark long may it roll,3
i struggled between giving 1 or 2 stars really should be 15  i agree with others regarding the rudesurly male employee  i have the impression he is the owner or manager so i am not sure this will ever be addressed  the salads are good but value is poor  dont waste your time or money,1
renegade always has consistently great food its also very nice inside with an open atmosphere and classy decor i love everything on their menu and i usually get their salmon and best of all the bread pudding so nom my parents really like the creme brulee too great spot with great food,4
i must admitthe pies in here are amazing its not often youll  hear me saying i love pies haha but they are amazing herennit doesnt look like much to a passerby but keep an eye out for this charming little bakerynnthe prices are reasonable for the quality you get so its definitely worth a look,3
great concept and awful hours i like the bolanis being served right now theyre savory and one of the best ways to warm yourself up in the winter,3
stopped in at 530 for a quick dinner place was nearly empty except for a few regulars at the bar service was prompt and the food was fine nothing too remarkable,2
clean shop with friendly staffnnyou are not allowed to shoot certain types of firearms there unless you are a member class3  shotguns for example   the person i spoke to about this could not explain why they had this rule,2
i thought it was a joke when i called inquiring about patio dining sets and the guy who answered my call told me he didnt have a definitive answer on whether they did or did notwhat the heck,0
great korean owned restaurant server was very attentive and helpful,4
had the 6 and also an order of wings for the price it was great it was good but not great on the plus side its 24 hours,2
dont bother with the grilled chicken it was mostly bread the club was better and whats the deal with refills,0
you would think a taco shop would have better tacos than jack in the box but jib wins over this place  i had 3 tacos one beef and two steak  the beef taco was incredibly greasy malformed and had little flavor  the two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat and were also lacking flavori wont be back,0
yummy  the extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must  i tried the pork ramen bowl  order the extra noodles if youre not full off the bowlnnfriendly staffnngood portionsnnaffordable,3
very clean tasting pleasing meal,3
we ordered ramen with pork and the pork was just too fatty  i didnt understand why they chose pork belly  the broth was okay wasnt awesome and wasnt terrible  ill stick with something other than ramen and try something else next time,2
a little tiny tiny place with a huge huge line get there early or late  make sure to sign in on their waiting list as soon as you get there ramenmmmmmmmnmy bf and i didnt care much for the miso ramen but others were excellente   well definitely going back for more when we get a chance to visit lv,3
the ramen and the fried rise are amazing the only bad thing is the service was rude,3
the best ever everything about this place is awesome kimchee rice,4
i often crave for their tonkotsu ramen the soup is so full of taste and creamy no other ramen places can top that the texture of the ramen is great too took a few friends there on several occasions and not once i did not hear compliments wish the place was bigger though,3
so good so cheap so perfect,4
this place rox  the ramen was so good and flavorful but sometimes the ramen comes lukewarm maybe because there are too many people sometimes,2
small hole in the wall place worth searching for limited menu awesome place if youre craving for ramen  small menu very reasonable  every time ive been there i had to wait about 15 minworth the wait,3
compared to sora ramen i like this much better  we had the thin noodles and they were al dente the broth was also thicker and tastier try the takana fried rice with mustard greens it was also very tasty,4
great food attentive staff fast service expect a long wait friday and saturday nights to be seatedespecially if its a rainy day perfect for noodles,3
this place was alright to me not the best ramen but not the worst either ive had better but this could work if you need a quick fix on a budget,1
atmosphere is awesomethe menu itemsand taste eh servicemaybe cause it was a slow night they have less staff on hand but had to go to bar to get our drinks which were advertised half off during happy hourand was charged full price concept is good just need to work a bit harder on service and food,1
we loved our suite gorgeous and cleannnoise levelnone but maybe its because we came in the winter seasonnwill definitely stay here againnbtw out suite with separate living room was 45bucksnightawesome deal,4
basic chinese food youre getting exactly what you pay for duh close to my home quick run lots of food for the price,2
phenomenal bbq we had the brisket sandwich and the smokin plate everything exceeded our expectations im only sorry that we dont live closer,4
not the best in any town went for dinner and everything was in foil on warmers will not return,1
let me add to the 5 star reviews herennmy husband and i got the sampler plates and oh manwe are so glad we found this place best bbq ever brisket was tender  flavorful pulled pork was juicy and tender and smokey sausage was perfect sauces were amazingnnthe sides were all great get the beans,4
the show was the standard onion volcano and spinning eggs the food was nothing special as it went from bland to weirdly seasoned back to bland nawesome wait staff helped the score but the price and overall food experience means i most likely return,1
i went there again today and this time had the sin city smashburger it was just as good as the spicy baja burger the sin city had bacon an egg lettuce cheese and crispy onions it makes me want to go try another item off the menu soon,3
ok place pleasant staff  average burger  better than the other big burger chains  but not 5 guys or innout,2
i deducted 2 stars because the yogurt was not that frozen  actually kind of runny and melted fast  otherwise a fun place and fun staff,2
great frozen yogurt good prices tons of topping choices staff is always nice love the retro feel of the inside,4
pretty cool place considering its just a selfserve yogurt shop   the price was average i think 39 cents an ouncennthe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings  my wife especially liked the chocolate rocks  and they had some unique flavors which i havent seen at other yogurt shops,3
love the rewards card,4
went here because of a groupon  14 for 14 five topping bread sticks and two pints domestic  great deal great service but for a pizza place the pizza was very sub par,2
came here with my bestie for a massage cz we got very bored in our hotel oh man this place really can work it it was very relaxing and i actually didnt feel like kicking someone in the face while they touched my toes lol coming back here everytime i visit arizona,4
i love this place  they are very hard working therapists that offer massage for extremely reasonable prices  i can afford to be a regular here because of the low cost,4
this place rocks best sicilian style pizza in las vegas by far get the naked city and add meatballs meatballs and sausage are made in house and you will be able to tell immediately hardcore slayer on juke box while writing this,4
ordered the bun thit nuong a lot of the pieces of meat were either all fat or mostly fat some fat is ok but majority fat is not good in my book their fish sauce was too sweet for my liking on to the next vietnamesepho restaurant,1
not worth the wait if you go with a big party,1
well this restaurant sucks i wrote my name in a waiting list in that list i have 2 party in front of me but after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my que number to 5 for no reason i think they give it to other people that he knows terrible suck,0
the bun bo hue was great but the egg rolls were spoiled we had to tell them to take it backgross,2
took my friend to try his first pho here it was my first time here too the pho wasnt half bad probably the best pho in vegas lots of meat in the pho broth was flavorful we also ordered the spring rolls and nem nuong roll it was fresh and yummy will try this place again my next vegas trip,3
very fresh and fast servicethe pho broth is perfectthe food is clean and the place is cleanwhat best you can expect from all pho or vietnamese restaurantthe only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambianceyes for restaurant is count,3
i was drunk and in the plus from gamblingi had a great burger late night and mixed drink they called a root beer float it was fucking delishhhni got the meal for free but i tipped its price it was that damn goodn nill definitely come backnthe service wasgreat too,2
not very friendly i mailed a package today and had my 2 young kids with me and they rushed me out of the way at the self kiosk so they could help someone else,2
everyone there is so pleasant,4
wow i can not believe the poor service i received from john this place is not worth your time it looks nice from the outside but thats it if you want to pay for over priced mexican than waste your money here if not go somewhere that is worth it,0
disappointing  after reading the positive reviews  we gave vida a try for dinner  i agree with another reviewer that it was subpar  better choices are out there,1

incredibly good bread pastries and coffee  the croissants and baguettes are just like what you can buy in france,4
the pastries are works of art  we almost hate to bite into them since they are all so beautiful the croissants are delicious also i have suggested this bakery to numerous friends and everyone has been impressed with the beauty and quality a true gem,4
great atmosphere with the french maitre d the food is nothing special but the atmosphere always makes us go back fixed menu is good value mostly have to book as it gets very busy,3
i had the butaburger as it was all the flavors that i lovethe burger was surprising good i didnt expect it to be as bomb as it wasi was like 2nd in line and they were crazy fast too which is always appreciatedmy only gripe is that its kinda expensiveother than that awesome,3
food streats across from the el cortez was amazingso many people live djs cool booths and great food trucks nni had the fuku karai spicy burger and it was really good soft spicy and yummy i also enjoyed the thick  fries,4
one of my staples i no longer get asked for my id when using my credit cardvery bad sign just cant beat the hot and ready deal and crazy bread i may get my pizza here all the time but the price is pretty close the quality however totally worth it in a pinch,2
really good soupsngreat place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time,4
the breakfast is consistently great here at a reasonable price and if you go to the val vista and baseline store the customer service you will get from hector is second to none,4

im letzten jahr sind wir etliche male dort hessen und es war sehr gut in diesem sommer jedoch war weder das essen noch der service auf dem niveau wie wir es kannten es hat sehr lang gedauert bis das essen fertig war und dann war dieses geschmacklich ziemlich fad und langweilig schade eigentlich,1

wunderbare filme in heimeliger atmosphu00e4re ein typisches programmkino mit dem dazugehu00f6rigen publikum hin und wieder muss man eben auch filme mit nur 18 weiteren personen im saal ansehen dafu00fcr ist die schauburg genau das richtige,4
war schon u00f6ffters dort und finde denn restaurant nicht so der knaller fu00fcr das gebotene zu teuer fleischnoft sehr trocken bedienung geht soambiente drausen nicht schlecht vielleicht  kann man dort notfalls essen gehen,2
man muss schon ein wenig warten bis man seinen du00f6ner in der hand hu00e4lt aber das warten lohnt sich es gibt hier einen halben du00f6ner der mit viel liebe zubereitet wird zu einem unschlagbaren preisnnn essen,3
so einen schlechten du00f6ner hatte ich noch niendie vorigen bewertungen kann ich nicht nachvollziehen sorry,0
the best  theyve worked out all the kinks that were present in the first weeks they openedback to great food great service  the sparkling sangria is a must,4
great tapas for vegas  loved the grilled octopus  the menu is super hard to read and they need to work on that  shrimp al fuego  bomb tons of calamari in one order awesome bacon wrapped stuffed dates  not the best sangria thats for sure,2
had a great time tonight our server mandy was fantastic very sharp and on point with our order i am sitting in her section from now on,3
an older pool that could use some repairs and new lounge furniture  it doesnt have the pizazz of some of the other places on the strip but at least it isnt too crowded  it does take forever to get there from the hotel rooms which was a pain  oh and theres a lovely view of the parking garage,2
not the same as famiglia in nyc and double price tasted like some typical hotelcantina dogfoodflavored sbarro,1
the absolute worst arbys they shorted me 2 deluxe sandwhiches and when i called after driving 10 minutes home the manager pretended not speak english not worth driving back over there stay away,0
the food isnt to bad  its a great local bar  very friendly and great bartenders,3
hierher fahren wir eigentlich nur zu 3dvorstellungen damit die fahrkosten nicht teurer als der eintritt werden die sitze sind bequem und sauber das bild perfekt am sound fast nichts auzusetzen die preise liegen mit 12 euro im durchschnitt gute parkmu00f6glichkeiten gibts im parkhaus nebenan,3

good food but dining in isnt recommended ill stick to delivery next time parents were craving chinese and from our experience from delivery the food was good but didnt think dining in would be that bad  they should just be a delivery resto no dining in,3
unfortunately this place has closed,0
the boba drink was terrible but the shaved ice was good,2
i love the field of green saladnnservice not so much the bar lags on every drinknnother than that its a good place to go if your in fountain hills,2

good food but dont call the same day for reservations  they are rude on the phone and are not helpful when you do call not good customer service,0
i like the prices for beer the food is ok definitely not awful the atmosphere is fun and everyone is very friendly,2
incompetent manager that wasnt able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another cardluckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service can be as poor as they want it to be,1
the service is excellent the food is some of the best mediterranean food ive had particularly in pittsburgh the falafel salad is light and delicious and the pastistio is perfection,4
enjoyed a healthy and delicious lunch from a very diverse menue  delightful attention and atmospherehighly recommend the alternative experience  ill definitely return,4

always like butter love the bbq sauce,4
good food and prices but nothing that surprises i could not taste any wood in the barbecue the ribs were fall off the bone and the cole slaw is excellent i thought the staff very pleasant if you are in anthem this is a reasonable place for a decent reliable lunch,2
rolled tacos and bean burrito for xmas breakfastnfree wifi cold waternnot busynshould be very few places open todaynworth a try,2
not great but worth revisiting the grilled chicken sandwich was awesome,2
not bad but other nearby places offer better bang for the buck ugh and the skinny white chair was extremely uncomfortable not ideal for dining out the seat of the chair had no padding and was too thin a rethink of the chairs are a must and should be made an immediate priority,2
gotta agree with the praise for los gemelos great 3 sopes tasty tacos too all freshly made that should be freshly made contento,3
mittagspause gemacht essen und trinken waren flott am platz bedienung nett zum abkassieren war dann aber irgendwie keiner zustu00e4ndig am ende hab ich das geld auf den tisch gelegt und bin gegangen trotzdem den bus verpasst nochmal 20 minuten warten mist,1
classrooms are datednis overflow from george squarencobble and stone charm,2
if you enjoy over paying for mediocre food and horrendous service graze is the place for you,1
good food it can be a little expensive but quality the cheese curds were worth the buy they have a good happy hour but otherwise ive never been here for a meal as a student and then young professional starting out it was just too expensive,3
great food good atmosphere just a little bit pretentious,3
stopped in to this joint for lunch one day and ordered brisket  they had pulled it for sandwiches instead of slicing it  was stringy and tough  may try again later may not nnmy quest for good brisket in the valley continues  so far famous daves is my top choice,1
my roommate and i bring our 3 dogs here to play at least 3 days a week we love the doggie water fountains trees the amount of available shade and seating everyone in my house can realistically spend hours enjoying this park thank you,4
we take our dog dakota there every weekend and sometimes during the week the best time to go is early morning when other dogs are there to play you will see the same people and dogs routinely which is also a plus very clean too highly recommend for those who live close by,4
this is our quick go to  i love the variety of single slice choices  all of the food is always consistent and good  i have had better italian however its reasonably priced  it is always busy and sometime hectic  i would definitely recommend  much better than the other choices in the area,3
staff is awesome food is yummy my kids love smashburger  i prefer some other places but their food is still tasty,4
food was pretty good my smash fries didnt have much on them tasted almost like reg fries and the girl who brought us our food was rude when my girlfriend asked for more mayo,3
the ceviche was a delight we went here for our anniversary and were not disappointed at all everything was fresh and delicious,4
very good foie gras and pork belly over rice  price is decent compares to san francisco  great service located in a unique location  reservation yes  great cocktail and sake menu  for sure not for kids  i will come back,3
reviews are pretty much right on stiff drinks good prices for happy hour appetizers are pretty much canned salsa and cheap tortilla chips served on plastic plates on par with what dennys would serve if they were a mexican joint,1

great location to watch a summer storm roll in from the north nni had a cuban it was great the staff was super nice and inviting more of a down home feel then the normal server type experience i like that too nnprices seem fair for the quality nncheck it out,3
poor attempt at nachos chips half plate cheese n onions for 8 bucks sad at best,1
nice cozy atmosphere friendly service and a drink like the campfire mocha  sign me up  its basically like a coffee smore in a cup and oh so snugly wugly feeling on a dreary day  try it,3
coffee is better than most and yes they do a good flat white but as mentioned in other reviewers notes service is not up to itunfriendly and not interested in giving their customers an all round experience,2
only 8 lanes and they are over pricednhate the concept of reserving lanesndecent music and crowd,2

matties is a great addition to charlotte  it is comfortable and unpretentious  it is not a yuppie diner wannabe which is good  the portions are generous the prices reasonable and the value good  i have eaten at matties several times and have never been disappointed,3
reasonably priced and delicious this is the dumpling house of chinatownnnlarge variety and always savory  definitely worth the stop you can also make your own dipping sauce from the traditional ingredients at the tablennyou have every meat option  veggy shrimp pork beef etc,3
if you want dumplings this is the place  if not dumplings are all they have  this is cash only despite what yelp lists  its in chinatown where the restaurants are not all real clean  this one falls in the middle,2
awful service the guy always find excuses to prevent you from paying by credit card food quality is nowhere near satisfactory,0
ok very dirty restaurant front and kitchen nalso took 30 mins for simple dumplings think they were flown in from queens,1
overpriced hidden fees bad service dirty,0
average and quite pricey for a froyo there a tons of new froyo that opens up around where i live and usually averages about 035ounces nnon the other note friendly staff and very clean place,2
tried my first poutine exactly what it says fries gravy and bland little cheese balls i think the rendition was good but the sentimental taste is better than it actually is  burger was average but on a nice roll street watching priceless,2
refried fries in stale oil jelly like gravy and chicken so chewy that goodyear wants the recipe yep if that is what you are looking for,0
greeted promptly ron iii was great  very patient while my 3 year old jumped from bed to bed and even played hide and seek with himall while talking about what my options were,4

spirit airline we had nothing but delays both ways and they were two hour delays the plane was not clean i have nothing good to say about them i would get another airline or would walk over taking then again plus there was a cup in my chair covered in gum ewwwwww,0
never again wish i had read these reviews first,0
terrible dirty airline charges ridicules fees for carryonsnthe upgraded service is expensive and not worth the costnnplease fly another airline jet blue is a better service,0
never flying this lousy airline ever again nnthey screw you over at every opportunitynni wish there was a way to give zero stars,0
yeahnot flying this airline again cheap tickets arent that cheap after everything is said and done website sucks online check in was an unnecessary hassle,0
3 out 4 delays in 6 month period thats unacceptable  we are gonna find a different airline,0
hands down the worst airline i have ever flown on they have a sneaky fee policy for everything and the customer service is horrendous the customer is never right and if you argue too much theyll deny your boarding pass i will never fly with them again,0
just very bad all around   checkin was complicated charged for a standard carrying and crew at departure gate was clueless  extremely unprofessional with lots chaos and loud conversations in what looked like a very standard boarding group,0
we have ordered from barros before and had good expereince ordered wings extra crispy and barros special pizza  showed up 45 minutes  pizza was not cooked through and hubby had to put wings on the grill i dont like it when i pay top dollar to eat out and they cant get it right,1

pho mailan is a good restaurant with good service i always get the summer rolls and pho meatball which both have great flavor i usually go in on a sunday evening as they have the football game on a flat screen glad there is one near home now i will definitly be back,2
perfect service polite staff clean restaurant excellent pho with perfect broth we just stopped here on our way back from arizona because we were craving phoeveryone is satisfied with their dish,4
fantastic service with friendly smiling staff from the moment i walked in atmosphere is bright and clean incredibly fast service with deliciously fresh flavors so worth the drive,4
apparently they dont have room for new customers but they do have a list of competitors you can have but they dont know how well these guys work so thats really of no use sorry youre too busy ill find my own company,0
went recently and the sushi did not seem as fresh as i remember i am not sure i would go back,1

the grilled pineapple is a delicious addition to the adobada taco,4
delicious,4
sorry but i have a different opinion they give you mostly hard meat not real meat and its not worth the price,0
great spot worth the wait n the  the carne asada was great n el pastor meat delicious,4
the asada tacos are so good the best ive had in vegas just order them the way they come only 2 each and the service was super quick even though they were really busy,4
i always stop in here when im in vegas  its always busy regardless if i arrive at 1100am or 1000pm  thats how i know its good  ordered tacos al pastor  carne asada  best tacos in vegas as far as im concerned,4
the tacos are great but the system sucks big time you have to wait in three different lines if you want three different types of tacos and dont get me started if its a friday cmon people modernize and make it one line for everything 3 stars is all i can give you guys until you change your system,2
ive been back a few times and seriously this placeis awesome nnnni cant believe it how do they do it everyone who works here is so nice and happy i like all the tacos i eat all the tacos i smile about the tacos thank you place,4
out of business as of june 3 2011  when i called to make a reservation to use my groupon which does not expire until june 21 i was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer and that the groupon would not be honored when they reopen  these people are thieves,0
their food is okay but they continuously change their menu and business name its very very irritating and confusing i am done ordering from this place,1
this looks so good but i dont know where the menu is,3
this is our favorite breakfast place the food is good they have the best biscuits  gravy of any restaurant i have eaten at the wait staff is friendly the only complaint i have is that sunday mornings are packed so there can be a wait to be seated,4
good service food was ok ive tried the pancakes twice and how can i put this theres no way around it theyre not good they were burned the first time and both times hard and not very tasty the basic fare eggs bacon potatoes were good but biscuits will not be my first breakfast place choice,2
one of my favorite places for breakfast the chicken fried chicken is amazing try it with the hash browns your taste buds will be thanking you all day reallynnalso note worthy are the breakfast burrito with chorizo and the champion pancake,4
it was good big portions with tasty biscuits,2
can i just say i love brandon and so do our two silky terriers he came as referral and im so thrilled to have found him hes so flexible kind and does a great job every single time i love that he is a cage free groomer,4
didnt think that it was all that the food was a little bland and uninspired but that seems to be the state of mexican food here in vegas seriously do i have to go to del taco to get a good chicken taco,1
gone so far downhill they should just close this location had probably the worst carne asada burrito any place in vegas has ever servednshould have been suspicious when it was ready in like 90 seconds they worst reoverheated leather beef jerky that i have ever tried to chewnnavoid this place,0
the rolled tacos were like chewing hard rubber and the carne asada burrito had a stale tortilla around bland meatnnhaving enjoyed robertos in other cities i was very disappointed in the quality here and will not be back,0
we stopped by on a whim mistake 25 minutes between appetizer and main course no explanation no apology food was good but not worth that kind of wait,0
yummmm is all i have to say  the chicken fingers were delicious and im not sure of what they do to their fries but they were really good as well i wasnt a huge fan of their new bourbon sauce or their chipotle bbq very watery but everything else was good ill definitely go again,3
one of the best local places they serve big and juicy pieces and not to mention their fries they might be a bit thin but theyre really good and taste fresh,4

i completely dig this grocery well as much as a dude can dig a grocery store  i just happen to always go here because it is so close,3
conveniently located inside of caesars palace however theyre not a part of the total rewards program that caesars is a part of nnwhy would this matter well cause you cant claim your free birthday drink here nnwhile not my personal favorite its not a bad bar to try,2
like the food but what is it about this location and the music always way too loud the staff is friendly but dont go here expecting to be able to chat with the people you are having lunch with some days its like being at a nine inch nails concert,2
cant wait for my weekly ok  sometimes daily coffee or chai fix   great coffee atmosphere and relaxing  amber is a great barista   try it youll definitely be back,4
lots of great information by a guide who knows a lot about the mob history of vegas unsure exactly the real need for the bus but i guess its like a minitheater we enjoyed the info  the drive wasnt really necessary,2
this is the only place i trust to do my waxing services they have a nice relaxing facility with friendly and skilled staff  ive been to a few other salons and the european wax chain horror show nothing compares in quality or comfort,4

closed  out of business,3
the location is great being in the centre of places des arts and the decor is great they have really good cocktails but the food is just below average go there for the drinks and the ambience not for the food,2
absolutely horrible  i took one bite of steak and then proceeded to spend the next 15 minutes chewing it  flank steak can be succulent and tender if cooked properly  after sending it back sans one bite and telling my waiter that i didnt care for it i was still charged for it  class act brasserie t,0
the decor here is adorable it made me want to sit and stay a while i had my first macaroon well two mixed berry and raspberry people always rave about them not necessarily from here but in general so i decided to indulge i didnt love or hate them ill definitely be back to try other options,2
while it wasnt bad there are far better places to have an enjoyable meal in the area even if you want to catch a game  we went once  we saw  we havent been back,1
ordered basket of wings today for take out told me 20 mins waited for 40 mins really the owner ron was there told him and he did told the manager to look thats it no one appeared to be really sorry as they dont care  really,0
my dad and i wanted to try their philly cheese steak and the place was good and food was good too but the reason why 1 star is because they cant give you the exact change they may round it out close to it and they only carry 25u00a2 there and its sad so they lost another customer,0
it was alright sort of a mix between buffalo wild wings and the outback pretty noisy and only one steak on the menu but the burger was decent,2
if you choose this place sit at the bar good place to watch sports menu finally revised and not so dark inside try it again if you were disappointed before,2
i would like to give a review but they were out of mostly all the great goodies that were recommended to me therefore i will have to go back after the holiday,2
the food was mediocre compared to the taiwanese type food i have at home mostly the same dishes but different flavor i will not come back here,1
i used to go here a lot but then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now i still like the waitresses its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now,2
the three star yelp average review is correctnnpizza quality differs every time i go there its either very good or very bad and nothing in betweennnhipster servers somes care sometimes dont cross your fingers before you venture to brick,2

visited stacks and yolks for the first time today and the food was delicious and plentiful  the service was prompt and attentive and the restaurant was clean i will definitely be back,4
my god this place keeps getting better and better even when theyre so busy that the line is out the door around the corner,4
the food is ok had a really good dish just once  the other few times it wasnt anything special the food takes a pretty long time to get to the table and there are always flys in the restaurant the staff is nice,2
very good take out chinese food reasonably priced and we got tons of food we were very happy with our order i belive we had the take out special for 4 and it was around 45 delivered delivery was very quick,3
had my car towed recently by these guys customer service is not something they are told to have got picked and the moron driving had such an attitude never would i use these guys again,0
this is the most expensive starbucks ive ever been to  it was over 10 for a drip coffee an apple a yogurt and a chocolate bar  bleh  also super slow service  but friendly  i wouldnt complain except for the toxic sticker shock,1
i knew five guys back when there was only one in the dc area so the chain concept really doesnt work for me  dont get me wrong the food is good but just not as good as five guys used to be  so glad to have them downtown at cityscape though and hope they do really well,2
solid chicken pad thai and a good bang for your buck for the amount you get sweet lunch special for like 7 bucks i think this is my goto for quick thai that is always solid,3
finally found my thai place great food decent prices and a rewards card for regulars sweet found this place last week ate there 3 times already love it,4
3 hour wait for reinstatements i dont know how they work the queue here6 people ahead of me for almost 2 hours will go to another dmv location next time,0

another sprinkler repair co that did not show i finally called sprinkler man he was right on time and fixed it fast,0
eli and his crew are great they take great care in making my yard look the way i want it and eli follows up after every visit to make sure im happy and get feedback i highly recommend them,4
terrible experience and service if you order food during happy hour check the pricing the waitress wouldnt correct her mistake and kept on giving excuses not cool,0
the chicken tacos are great i hate them two days in a row since i am not out here much,3
it was just ok in a strip mall i think it caters to the younger moviegoing crowd the food was bland i had to wait over 10 minutes for salmon teryaki i did not like the fact everything was served in styrofoam everything  i will not go back,1
not the best nor the worst,1
the sushi is great everytime i go the staff is friendly and very helpful downside the price is a little high,3
cheap covered parking and the shuttles get you to the airport in minutesif you book online you can get it for even cheaper,4
yum i love their vegetable broth and garnishes and everything great servicefast and great food what more is there to say,4
way over priced bartender is cute in the face but clearly miserable beer tap selection is far  wide though,1
in bar waiting no service just stupid  need new management,0
no wifi very small low ceilings equipment is very close together,1
5 stars for sure this place has the best char siew in town  its lean and just enough sauce without drowning it like most other places make the mistake of doing,4
my cousin and i went to this place together and she was not a fan of it if she could rate it from 1500 she said she would rate it 500 but its a negative it wasnt my cup of tea eithernnote that the wallpaper is hideous and their decorations consist of chili peppers dangling from the wall,1
freddy is fantastic  i needed a valve replaced in my toilet so it would flush and called freddy who arrived within an hour on a sunday and charged me less than half of what other plumbers were quoting me for a sunday repair  hes very honest and reliablethank you so much for your help today,4
i had an issue with plumbing and did needed it fixed that evening  service was quick only had an hour window an problem was fixed quickly  i definitely recommend freddy fox rooter,4
great mixology drinks very creative  look for groupon 2 for 1 drinks good atmosphere i would recommend if you are downtown and just wanted to hangout and listen to some breakin beats,4
so so food had to send back a sandwich twice but they were very nice about it i agree with who ever posted the comment a few weeks ago about them putting up stickers blighting the neighborhood on street signs and light poles,1
the lasagna was ok the meat was good but it was a light on the tomato sauce my husband had the chicken parm hero which was good our server recommended the alfredo which i wish i would have gotten,2
horrible service good food but horrible service,1
awww was so good when i was here before went for nice dinner was disappointed best things were the entrees got the pork shoulder good all friti and vegetable things that were so good before but lost it now sugar settled in the wine bottle shouldnt have been served would recommend skipping,1
i will echo the comments of everyone else this was a pretty cool statue in the middle of an industrial park although it technically is a fountain i wouldnt go out of my way to see it but if you are in the area its worth the stop,3
finally a coffee shop by work  the muffins are simply delicious  i had pumpkins lemon poppy seed and blueberry to date  nnearlier today i tried the ice tea  it was flavored and infused with a berry shot  simply delicious  nna good place to sit back read a paper and kick back,3
weve popped by for happy hour a few times great prices love the wings great atmosphere especially when its patio weather,3
they have so much in their store it sometimes takes a while to get through it from kid items pokemon etc to very adult themed items in the back they are located at the galleria mall upstairs near the food courtnvery friendly and helpful staff i found a minion iphone case there and love it,3
service is getting bad after a couple years relatively been ignored multiple visits and have never been offered a water refill after the glass being empty for 20 minutes the foods still good but i take back what i said of relatively good service depending on the night i wouldnt expect much,1
the service is very very slow the server is on her first rotation by herself with a group of 17 wtf the food was cold no other server or manager came to help her out i finally had to complain after 1 12 hours to the manager i will never go here again,0
so we have been in anthem for awhile and have gone to this restaurant many times even through all the numerous owners so far we are not thrilled the food is average and the service is slow the bar is nice and there is seating outside which is great however not the best mexican food,1
this restaurant doesnt exist anymore it was replaced by another chinese restaurant and there is no buffet allyoucaneat option,0
great airport bar that is quick and easyand good  def recommend if your waiting for a plane outta charlotte,2
the angus reserve burger at 12 was a frozen patty cooked to whatever the chef feels like cooking  if you looking for food or drinks there are other places in pittsburgh  come on tap room how many local breweries are located around pittsburgh  update your selection,0
i would definitely recommend going to the waddelllitchfield location this location always seems to be a little dirty and disorganized,1
i recently went here for my first time and was blown away i absolutely loved their green tea smoothie the staff was exceptional and after hearing that it was my first time the lady gave me a 1 off coupon and explained their punch card system to me i will def be returning here,4
zero stars really disappointed at the deal we got for pizza pizza is marginal at best and felt we got sold a bill of goods as we spent way too much for what we got,0

the line at the wicked spoon was too long so we headed over to the mall  this was the first place that we saw  as 3 starving hungover girls it satisfied us just fine  i ordered the chicken fajitas which were surprisingly tasty  the service was definitely slow and the sodas cost 4 a pop,2
beers and bullsnnwhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull  hilarity ensues along with pantie shots  oh and you dont have to walk through the casino to take a leak cause the pisser thats how cowboys say bathroom is right there inside the bar,2
im here everytime i visit las vegas and im here often i absolutely love it the bartenders are always friendly the food is awesome ive had wings and burgers here the atmosphere is amazing highly recommend this place for sure,3
sat around for 15 min a guy came around to ask us to drink gave us water and took forever to even come by to ask what we wanted fuck this shit no good service what so ever,0
this is our second time here in four days the food has been great the music is very chill beer is cold on hot vegas days the only reason for the four of five stars is the service has been unfriendly for both for both visits however we will return in the future hope this helps,3
the quality of sushi was excellent  that was the only good thing about this place  there is no reason on this earth that it should take over 45 min to get 2 rolls and i nigiri   terrible service  nearly walked out  also a bit noisy,1
i found this restaurant late at night and it was really awesome the chicken was amazing but the potato balls with rice and sweet sauce were the best things i ate in montreal,4
this is a great quality taco bell recently built with fast service and consistant food i love taco bell because its cheap and yummy,2
robert reeves is a fantastic dwi attorney he is a zealous advocate for his clients and always does his best to obtain a favorable outcome,4
this place is always such helpful to me the employees greet you when you first walk in the door they are helpful to and its always nice in the store this is by far my favorite walgreens in las vegas i recommend everyone to come and check this one out,4
cupcakes were decent but nothing id go out of my way for cake part was more on the dry side and the icing was crazy sweet i may return but it will only be to try the macaroons,1
shouldnt the 15 minutes be already up for the cupcake,1
food was not good  made teach bell taste like 5 star  carnitas were so tough they were like old jerky  will never be back,0
many flavors and great choice of toppingsnonly 39 centsoznstaff was kind and helpful as wellndefinitely recommend this place for a good yogurt,4
here for dinner with my family  we were staying at the pointe hilton squaw peak resort  nice location casual dining  good menu with choices  service was ok food fairly well prepared although lamb was overcooked for one of our party  overall ok experience,2
their macaroons were okay the first time i had them at a potluck they were really good thats the reason i decided  to go today and bought 3 diff flavors i wasnt too happy about it i think it was the texture of the cookie,2
super slow service compared to other ebs ili go to the one on sahara even though its 10 minutes out of the way next time,1

sage chicken and waffles and andys chicken benedict are always the best got the watermelon kiwi lemonade this timeit was a little sweeter than i typically like but the flavor was terrific,3
food portions were huge food was just meh,1
love love love nall you need to do is order dessert here it comes in small shot glasses  the flavors explode in your mouth,4

tasteless this visit for the lunch menu had to soak the tacos with sour cream salsa salt and pepper they were still lacking taste hopefully it was just the cook wont consider coming back anytime soon,1
really good service prices are what you would expect i couldnt find anything on sale,3
massage services were great hair was subpar i had to go back for a recolor i wouldnt go back there again,1
bad service with worse food  its hard to screw up simple chips  queso and a hamburger but somehow they managed to do it  there must be a curse with the location because apparently nothing can stay in business there fingers crossed kennedys experiences the same fate and something better comes next,0
barely mediocre bar food  our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy  ive had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price  not worthy of a return,1
a phoenix coffee shop open past 9pm praise the baby jesus,3
came here a few weeks ago with friends breakfast was good tea was nice atmosphere ok i wasnt blown away but i also wasnt disappointed i love the location and the interior is vintage and original the outside was ok to have breakfast and enjoy the weather moderately priced,2
have had several desserts from this shop and the one word that comes to mind whenever i think of this place is dry nnevery dessert from the cookies to the cupcakes to the loafettes are all dry nni wish i could say more but i think that pretty much sums it up,1
i love the concept of this place but at 9 for an adult admission im disappointed in the number of items and selection that were on collection in the galleries nnhowever if you want to support the preservation of black art this is a great place to spend an hour in,2
drive thru  super friendly and always remember us and what we like to order,3

heres the quick and dirty i can see how some people may like it here however if youve ever had a real crepe this place wont do it for you the toppings are very standard although they have lots its all sweet or sweeter nothing really exciting or new happening here,2
great food fish tacos the best and the beef nachos are great comes with queso mmm so good  225 for taps 20oz  and same with the  margaritas the burritos are good but to much lettuce so say easy lettuce and extra meat,3
not a bad haircut but brought the neckline up too high and trimmed some edges in a strange way  not the best haircut ive gotten but not terrible either,2
friendly but just cant seem to get my hair right after several times trying to tell them how i wanted it seems like its just cut how they want oh well i give up luckily hair grows  best of luck to you all,1
first off i was annoyed for waiting over half an hour for waffles it wasnt over crowded so that was just lame this place is over hyped nothing special just a bunch of different toppings on waffles big whoop the food isnt bad its just not anything special,1
i love this waffle cafe food is great and its always clean when i go  the staff is very nice,4

one of my favorites outdoor dining and entertainment in summer is best on east madison or sun prairie  constant menu changes my only frustration keep the scallop pasta on there and id be 5 star,3
always passed this place and finally today stopped in for a burrito i got the al pastor pork burrito it was a little heavy on the refried beans but overall was a very nice burrito ill come back again and try other things,3
terrible they have nothing of any interest there  not worth it,0
the park is probably better known for its 65 miles of single track mountain biking trails  it has a little something for all skill levels but its very rooty,3
great gear quality products and amazing customer service,4
one of my favorite stores for shoes wonderful selection i especially love the clearance section organized by size super boot collection and great deals on purses self service so very comfortable environment,4

the food was great and service was fast  place was very busy on a wednesday evening and they accommodated us for 3 without any reservations  highly recommend making this a stop while in the phoenixscottsdale area,4
i was very disappointed in the food portions were quite small and monochromatic in tasty we had to ask for bread the dessert was very dry all around skimpiness and not worth the money there are many restaurants for tha same money around,2
great food great atmosphere cold beer if we lived closer we would be there all the time,3
great big bar best burger in scottsdale yet 4 mini pitchers,3
mean waitress long wait for food soso food creep patrons but good musicdirty interior,0
about 2 miles off the highway but worth the stop 3 for a 5 turkey grinder all the toppings and 180 for an eegee frozen drink the tables were clean and the service was fast,4
delicious sandwiches and soups  dont just get the desserts,4
large cake portions good selection of macaroons but i thought the almond croissant was way too sweet i love my sweets but that was just unbearably sweet and i couldnt even finish the small portion the almond croissant from la belle terre was much much better,3
there is nothing positive at all unkind staffs and damp popcorn the worst popcorn that ive tasted,0
went wednesday night at 9 pm very busy and always good,3
man what happened this location has gone downhill in the past few months wheres the old crew that made this location special,1
great vibe and location for we s phx folk but ye gods beware ordering a house cabernet during happy hour  12 a glass  for happy hour house wine  are you kidding  nnthe hhr food is a great deal well be ordering beer next time phew  nncaveat emptor  bring a high limit credit card,1
crisy pata ftw we always have to order a large for the table or for home along with whatever combos we get  its a must try  dip with the soy sause that they provide or the lechon sauce,3
been to this place a few times over the last 2 years and it was pretty decent up until recently when i ordered the beef caldereta and the meat was spoiled and the wife got the bisteak that also tasted old and spoiled very disappointed,0
i had the bbq chicken pizza which was very good  i think the extra topping prices are a little high and it would be nice if they had some more options but overall pretty good,3
best pizza joint in town  never disappointed the asian cashier is always on point i dont think i gotta tell him my order anymore cuz i think he memorized it  good atmosphere and i highly recommend this place,4
first of all it was fun   but the people they hired to work for them are jerks   pushy rude oh did i mention rude,1
my kids rode on the zip line again and had a great time,3
i had the pad see ew  it was pretty mediocre  too sweet slight burnt taste and not very flavorful  food presentation was lousy just dumped on the plate without garnish  service was indifferent even though there were few customers  there are much better and still authentic thai restaurants in town,1
incredibly overpriced  no valet parking available horrible service at the bar  requested feather free room and all pillows were feather  called the front desk three times and waited 90 minutes before they were replaced  unless you get a rate less than 140 it isnt worth it,1
i like this place i dont love it but i do like it a lot its a charlotte institution and the food is very good the only thing that threw me off is that the onion rings are very soft not thick as expected still good,3
what a great spot for good burgers and dog we enjoyed both  they were served quickly and cheap prices we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries hot  cooked to perfection i am a ketchup girl but they served them with a creamy mustard dipping sauce that was a great second option,3
my son went and got us subs for dinner last night   i had the jjblt   not good   the bacon had an odd taste and despite my request for crispy it was soggy   i ended up eating a lettuce mayo and tomato sandwich  disappointing consumption of calories,1

i had one subpar meal there the meat was not very flavorful the tortilla nothing near authentic  tried it again just to be sure and the second time it was again suppar  nnthere is definitely better mexican food to be had in the scottsdalephoenix area,1
horribly slow here with food and some items were just downright foul eggs in the breakfast burrito  hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce  no real drivethru  what the heck,1
this is great mexican fast food no fuss no muss straightforward good food,4
trisha is awesome,4
when a company refused to give out their list of ingredients and lies to the customer as to what is in the yogurt it is called deceit  please be weary as this place does not use all natural ingredients and their sugar free flavors have tons of sugar in them  buyer beware,0
food was ok but not the best  i havent gone there in almost a year and when i paid the bill i realized why i havent almost 250 for a glass of oj and they dont give free refills again food was ok but there is definitely better,1

this is in the food court in fashion show mall  this was a pretty good meal for the price  i ordered the cubano and was quite pleased,3
very good food authentic spicy as indicated by name we went there for dinner twice during our short visit to vegas and we were happy both times,3
we tried out the lunch specials and found them to be pretty good  for about 6 we both got healthy portions of spicy food along with fairly good service  take a chance and go for the hotter dishes,3
they put a sign that says 75 off on frames then i went to pay for it they said its full price  wrong info   making the customer confuse,1
food ok service below par nit seems bit amateurish and would not suffer from some more experienced staff and management,2
terrible silverware was not cleanservice was super slowfood was mediocretook about an hr to get food on lunch break and had to get it to go and order was incorrect as wellnot my daddy to say the least,0
we came here a few months ago but i can definitely say i wont be back the food and service were slow really slow the food was also nothing spectacular portions were small and dismal looking definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer,0
white cheddar queso with bbq chicken need i say more,3

i have to say i am really not impressed with this place  service was spotty the food was sub par,1
horrible for the overpriced food,0
the food was how to say this without offending white people version of mexican  it was bland to the taste overcooked and bland and god forbid they make it themselves rather than pour it directly out of the can it was edible though slightly overpriced for what you get,1

ended up here on a whim we needed a dog friendly patio the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly i had the street tacos with sea bass amazing my husband had the bison burger with the kale salad he loved it the cocktails were fantastic i wish fox would open one here in tucson,4
everything here is amazing their pizza is bomb its not on the menu anymore but ask for the kale pizza its to dieee for their turkey lasagna is also my go to their flavored margeritas are also really good and i dont even like margaritas that is all,4
filthy too busy horrible layout for the playground area and there are bees and wasps everywhere the train and carousel are overpriced not a fun park,1
we just moved to las vegas and one of the things i try to find early when i move is a good bbq place gotta say buzz bbq was a good find the service was great ordered take out  server took ample time to help me with the menu the food even better well be back,3
closed at 2am instead of its advertised 3am we saw people inside and the waiters saw us but ignored us nnchange your closing time to 2am so people wont be trying to come at 215am to a closed establishment,0
less than expected  chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside but bland tasting  i ordered their sauce but ended up with only ketchup  fries were soggy oily and horrible  it took a good 35 min for my food  overall very underwhelming,0
is it the greatest sandwich on earth hell no but its fast and inexpensive with crisptasting ingredients and served on really fresh goodquality bread it is very good service is quick and efficient and the restaurant is clean the menu is easy to maneuver and i hear they deliver too,3
their employees have such bad customer service i stop going there i drive to target now,0

hands down best food in town ive tried everything on the menu and it all is better than the rest my favorite is the meatball pizza with onion and oregano,4

first time trying this place out and i must say its pretty good,2
great fresh mex love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa i dont think you can go wrong with anything from tia rosasnnthis is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years always fresh and good,3
not so great clip from my experience  im not going to write a book about it but the service is okay the workers are disgruntled bad ownership from what they said but my biggest petpeeve the stations are covered with hair and they didnt clean up prior to me being seated  i had to ask her to clean up,1
terrible service and food really disappointing other arribas are great waitress had a festering scab tattoo that almost made me sick wouldve left if i noticed it earlier shouldve called health dept,0
good crust overall an upgraded little ceaser or howies mostly take out setup hugh delivery area,4

amazing yumo best orange chicken i have ever had in my life i highly recommend this to everyone,4
some of the best coffee ive ever had  only thing that takes them down is the price,3
i called and left a message and emailed them through their website over a week ago and never got any response back  bummer,0
okay food nothing new or different your regular american food just double the price the most interesting thing they have is a dessert cart that they push around cool idea,1
1st pizza was a salt mine  the 2ed had no cheese or sauce and needed a steak knife to cut  chicken parm was soso  five stars for the staff who tried to make up for the kitchenss shortcomings  maybe 25 at best  also small pours of wine,1
excellent food drinks service and ambience i have not been let down by a dish yet if youve never been here id highly recommend that you try it you wont be disappointed,4
your average chinese buffet every meat on the buffet was high in sugar but they had a very good vegetable selection for my vegan wife basically if your craving a chinese buffet this one is about as good as any,3
this place is amazing it has its own vibe that draws just the right crowd of misfit artists you wont find a better place to spend an evening among art and artists,4

if you are a collector of star wars memorabilia this is the place even if they dont have it they will find it for you and get it ordered they also specialize in comics and gaming,3
nice place for a drink with good views for people watching  had the lobster mac and cheese which was very tasty with four cheeses and a decent amount of lobster beers were a bit overpriced live piano music was nice but it was extremely to loud service was good would go back again,2

smashburger was simply ok the food was not horrible but based on overall value it is not that great it is expensive for what is served,1
food is just ok and the employees ive dealt with are so rude girls and if you ask them for anything they act put out,1
the macn cheese was really lacking flavour the texas bbq beans and brisket were excellent the chicken a bit dry and they dont give you enough sauce,2
worst bbq i think i have ever had and an empty restaurant should have been a clue brisket was not brisket tasted more like roast beef wont be returning,0
i got a buywithmecom  gift for this spa as a  birthday gift  this year i have left two messages and not a call back and it has been 15 weeks  i do not recommend  going to this place as they are not professional,0
expensive but terrible food the lamb pasta recommend to me tasted worse than the lamb i could get from a mediocre indian fast food restaurant and the noodle need to be boiled longer the restaurant right next to it is much better,0
we went for breakfast and it was a great value for the money owner at the front is a nice guy only complaint was our waitress but i think she may have been new and still finding her groove  other than that aok,3
this is a nice mom  pop cafu00e9 with a personable staff always willing to help accommodate customers  owner comes to see if there is anything he can do to make your visit a good one prices are  reasonable cheerful and happy staff always meets  you with a smile omelets are huge,3
i go to cassie every time im in that side of town or go out of my way to go there she has always done an amazing job i trust her with my eyebrows its a clean and friendly environment,4
i am not going to lie this gym has a variety of equipment for everyone from you average joe to you bodybuilding competitor  but the front office staff is horrible  they just seem like they dont want to be there  and they are very unhelpful i love the gym it self just not the staff,1
this was just outstanding  what a great environment super wait staff and an amazing menu  though not extensive i wanted to try almost everything on it  so the quality is there  and the food is just excellent  highly recommend it and definitely make reservations  it is clearly a hot spot,3
came for lunch atmosphere is great and service was very good my lunch consisted of some lettuce dressing a sliver of grapefruit and 2 scallops all for 17 when the server asked i did mention the small portion and he was sympathetic but took no action so i was disappointed overall,1
very solid local breakfast choice everything that ive had hear was quite good the only downside is that there can be a long wait sometimesnndont be afraid to try the chicken on the coop its their version of biscuits and gravy,3
friend said he seen guy from the food network do a show here so we decided to come and check it out got here at 630am on the dot and ordered the enchiladas  the plate was very good and had good taste to it nnwas expecting a bit more but wasnt bad,3
i had the lunch special gyro it was ok for the price it was great value and would go again if i am craving a gyro and am in the area,2
awesome burgers and dogs with a great secret sauce,3
i cannot recommend this place more my dog absolutely loves his new food non top of it being super healthy for him the owner and staff are really helpful and friendly their dog food and their attitude actually made me feel like they love my dog as much as i do,4
overpriced bland food ive had a cheeseburger there three times and every one made me sick the only good thing they have is the breakfast sandwich but i wouldnt make a special trip for it,1
still same real good food but take out only  upper st clair township does not allow eat in due to lack of parking i was toldnnwe ordered a fresh walnut and gorgonzola salad and sausage calzone booth were real good  love the sausage,3
not the worst but by far not the best either service was very slow food was bland and experience was lacking will not return,1
this is great if you are in a hurry they have slices and salads ready to go above average quality and a nice open space too perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door,2
brewery tour radnnstaff are awesomennrussian bourbon aged stout is one of my top 4 favorites on earth,4
this place rocks   to be able to kick my feet up drink my wine have a blanket handy and watch a movie was a great experience  i only tried the dessert so maybe next time ill try some of the pizzas,4
wow a movie should be watched this way,4
they hosted our notre dame game watch party  we had a wonderful time great people great service and very good food,3
yuck this was the worst pho i have ever had bad broth ugly meat wilted veggies service was awful the dude up front was coughing violently and blowing his nose go to khai hoan i feel sick right now and may have food poisoningnnupdateni definitely got food poisoning from pho all seasons,0
standard chipolte not cheap on the meat like some stores long line during lunch but it moves fast,2
chef john sucks at everything luckily for him anna is a great bartender and is super hot,4
there are so many better burger places on the stripnnthe malts and buffalo chicken dip were unique and tastynnmost likely will not go there again,1
this place sucksntook way to long to  get our food,1
service has been very poor each of the three times ive been there  the food isnt worth the price,1
been here twice and yum  the shakes are delish  the turkey burger is so yummy  so are many of the others  if you are looking for a casual fun and tasty place for lunch or dinner this is a great pic,3
food is great here but the service need a great deal of improvement ex never check back refills dirty dishes all on table dont know if a manager is working or not oh wait she dropped off one of our burgers,1
service was very good but food was mediocre  for the price i expected much better,1
did they forget to toast my buns for the ahi tuna sliders i sure hope so because that would have made the sliders oh so much better,2
awesome veggie burger cant think of a veggie burger i enjoyed more  everything we ordered was delicious,4
what a great salmon salad they have on menu it is that good,4
very disappointed with our meal and the service its a new menu so there are kinks to be worked out but it besides the beef the burger was a mess also my drink was screwed up i was willing to put up with the noise and crowd but theyve really fallen off their game,1
yum place was good and adult shakes are great great place to hit up before heading to marquee for the day club pool dealie,3
had the kobe teriyaki forgot the fancy namennit was yum but too sweet for me 17 and  came with friesnnlobster mac and cheese was yum but toooo expensive for 6 bties it was a super small dish not worth it,2
mediocre food terrible service overpriced stick to in and out this place is overrated,0
solid burger i forgot what i ordered but it was definitely tasty that night was packed but this place was good,3
i had the pork slidersnbased on that i cant recommend the placenif youre staying at the cosmopolitan try one of the other restaurantsnthe service was good however,1
i do love this place they do my favorite food here mei fun and they do it really well the soup is delicious too and it comes out pretty fast which is always a plus,4
loved the food we had the chicken fried rice lo mein and egg rolls everything was tasty and the staff was friendly,4
i used a groupon and had brunch there  the french onion soup was just ok and the chicken salad sandwich on baguette was forgettable  i dont think i will be going back to this restaurant  the view was nice from the window though,1
we just went there for drinks but they were excellent and we had a great view of the strip at night actually it was probably my favorite view of any place we stopped over the weekend,4
hint reservation a mustncrowded great value for allyoueatpasta small  supplement for sausage meatballs chickennfriendly  cool food service by linzynnice small dessert samplerndelish pumpkin cheese cakenwine  beer,3
smashburger is my absolute favorite  i think its equal to innout if not better  i suggest the sin city burger  worth the pay,4
can never get enough please put more mushrooms on 4 dosent cut it,3
pretty damn gooda little overpricedhence only 3 stars love the interiorservice was greatlot of optionsmushroom swiss burgersweet friesgive it a shot,2
it is in a random location way off the strip nn1 delish garlic friesn1 really clean insiden1 great pricesn1 bacon cheeseburger is the bestnni wouldnt make a special drive for these burgers but it definitely a great place for a good burger,3
great atmosphere food,4
its starbucks so you know what to expect this location is very fast and accurate despite always being extremely busy,2
i heart beef bulgogi bento boxes,4
great food and reasonable prices,4
i love this place  its locally owned and i think its a family  they are from korea and the menu reflects some korean specialities as well as terrific freshly prepared and beautifully presented sushi  they have a good happy hour and reasonable nonhh prices  please patronize,3
went here for lunch  fantastic prices for some really good sushi  seriously good environment as well this is added to the once a week list for lunch,3
decent korean food for lunch   we ordered a grilled hamachi kama for an appitizer  it tasted good   my husbands lunch box included bulgogi california rolls salad rice and a couple of pot stickers  i had spicy pork which had good flavor  korean side dishes were okay nothing special,2
cottage express is quick delicious and has large portions best take out chinese in hickory grove,3
food was mediocre at best  plus they tried to over charge me  look at your bill carefully,1
i was given a glowing recommendation of this place because of their beef noodle soup but sadly it was a let down i appreciate the local joints attempt and the price is good but the soup was too sweet for the style they were selling,1
amazing service and amazing people no bs highly recommended best alternative for dealership  casa,4
super fast deliverynonly chinese place that offer wings  fries combonbest french fries ive ever had except at fast food placesnnupdate i dont know why i said the stuff above their food sucks,1
on a subsequent visit the shakes arrived promptly the food also  the waitress was also nicerbetter then our first visit  i had the wisconsin buttery which was yummy,2
i got the bbq burger and it was good for the price nothing special i wouldnt wait in a long line for it though love the crispy skinny fries but the ranch sucked lots of shakes to choose fromnnthis is also not a place to just sit hang out  talk  when you see the line you kinda feel obligated to leave,2
had to give the spot 4 stars the place is cool the food is good  the price is right d plus its  my casino southpoint d perfect spot to chill grub burger shake did i say chill you gotta try it,3
one of our favorite places to eat something to satisfy everyone  the burgers have plenty of toppings the chicken has just enough crisp on outside and tender inside the atmosphere is casual and fun 50s music,4
the burgers are very good ive had the bbq before  just had the i love bacon burger brisket  bacon yum tater tots are a must  love the beer specials 32 oz sam adams for 10  you get to keep the cup  all i have to say is i love i love burgers,3
not sure what the fuss is aboutthis place was good they had basics and some jazzy things and shakes were good as well,3
good burger and dog  great shake  great service  fast in   manager checked on us   fries a little cold   a bit pricey but so is rest of vegas,2
burgers and drinks were good service and appetizers were not that great,1
never brought the fries we ordered  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was told her we never received our order had to ask for them removed from bill no offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up,0
it was good i got a chicken burger but it was a little tough for me not very tender it still tasted good though sweet potato fries were great and it looked like they could make you any drink you could imagine very good alcohol selection fun atmosphere and our sever was nice,3
i ordered dante burger and parmesan fries for a joint called i love burgers i felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could bobbys burger palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here,1
great food and good service as well happy hour daily from 36 definitely put it on your sushi list  recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the sushi only,3
this place is amazing great food great service wonderful place we will definitely be back often,3
they have a great happy hour and the staff is awesome,3
service was great the staff was so friendly the sushi i had was great and the slices i had were nice and thick great find and great spot  looking forward to bringing friends and family,4
the service is outstanding and the food is wonderful my husband and i come here all the time  the management and the staff is friendly and helpful  the mardi gras roll is amazing,4
flies all over the food in the buffet and the manager was rude when we asked for a refund nasty,0
mmmmmmmm appetizer sampler is tasty  12 price drinks for ladies friday and saturday which means 14 price drinks all around   nice hockey rink     hockey on almost every tv   pizza looks good but am too full to order bartenders are cool   video blackjack dominated us,3
everything was great i couldnt believe they had roasted bone marrow you cant find that in any buffet i would of given it five stars if they had oysters and crab legs overall i will definitely be returning back to the wicked spoon,3
in buffet world you get what you pay for quality versus quantity here a little pricey but worth it great services too,3
this buffet was great when it first opened but has now fell off a bit over the past couple of months  i also believe the price has gone up yet the food quality has gone down  tourists might enjoy this buffet but being a locali will have to pass,1
awesome value 25 exceptional desserts gelato chocolate truffles macaroons  surprisingly tasty entrees gnocchi butternut squash ravioli cheese selection premium italian meat selection lox and grilled salmon were my favs consistently going back,3
for 35person but no olysters or sahimi  no way  its just not worth it  i dont understand why its rated four stars  if you put aside the dessert its a 15 buffet top   for same price id rather go to todai at planet hollywood,1
we are locals and this is the only buffet we will go to  we like that they have small portions so we are able to take a little of everything  very good food,4
wow this was some next level stuff every dish is quality and a lot of them are world class and you get to choose which ones you want i actually loathe buffets but i would come back to this one again,4
wicked spoon used to be my favorite buffet in vegas but the quality has gone down while the price came up it is still one of my top choices but  no longer deserves a 5 star,3
if you go a little after opening and its not busy the food will be cold and too salty  shame considering i went there 3 times 2 months ago,1
i dont know why people rave about wicked spoon so much  ive come here for both lunch and dinner and the food is okay  the kalbi ribs beet salad and bone marrow are the go to dishes  i much prefer wynn or the new buffet at caesars,2
if you can somehow overlook the pricenjust know its worth it everything i tried was good out of all the things my fav was the thai basil rice with egg lol im asian what can you say,4
great deal for breakfastlunch the food was amazing and there were lots of lighter delicious options so you werent eating straight heavy fat go here,3
the food was lacking flavor and taste we were there for the acf convention the service was lacking and non existing bussers,2
not just the best buffet weve had in vegas but possibly the best buffet weve ever had the quality of food is superb,4
yummy delicious fresh food  definitely worth the price,3
not a buffet person but this food is a great way to sample gourmet food  price perfectly and you wont be disappointed  i like the way the servings are arranged not buffet style but a personal mini sample spoon or plate  very cute  i liked the mini fry basket for the sweet potato fries,4
i had breakfast and didnt eat much enough said i thought this was a high end casino but it falls short big time in this joint,1
yum yum get in this belly and i mean pork belly at one point i had pork belly on my plate made 3 different ways the desserts are awesome too,3
very good buffetallot of great fancy selection of food and salad and dessertsbuetiful design and decorgood service and friendly,3
the feeling of being inside a gigantic chandelier was truly a novel experience however it wasnt worth the pretentiously pricey drinks weak drinks average service boring,2
ambiance is awesome service couldnt be worse ive been here twice  shouldnt have given it a second chance definitely will not give it a third there are so many other places worth visiting in vegas so go take a picture there but skip ordering a drink not joking,0
one of my favorite lounges in vegas for the generally upscale crowd ample seating and elevated vantage point from the 15 and 3rd floors,4
expectedly high priced drinks at this lobby bar in cosmopolitan i think one moscow mule was 16 with tax and tip included i guess this bar is good for prepartying or people watching i just hate spending this much on drinks though,2
not really worth the price to be honest its only so expensive because of the prime locationnnfood was okay nothing is very outstanding in my opinion,2
i have been to the one in washington dc and was already a big fan  i have also been to some of his other restaurants  goyou will not be disappointed,4
i was expecting so much more from this restaurant  there were a few hits  the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok  i expected to be wowed but walked away having spent 300 and it was just ok,2
the lunch is bad  it dont be worth the price 30  no way and the service is sosonthe worst thing is i filled 9 15 tips because i feel soso but they add the tips to 20 themselves asshole,0
show up on monday to place your order or pastys  pick up tuesday very good and love the brown gravy that goes with it nice friendly people running this very busy establishment were going to try breakfast there soon,3
the itty bitty tiny portions they give you is delicious  our bill was seriously 63 for a sandwich smaller then an english muffin cut up romaine with beef over it and a bowl of fried ricennwe ate at the airport about an hour later  we were starving,2
its fair feels like a dim sum style place ie order a few menu items and share bc portions are for sharing amongst people i would come here for tacos that seems to be the best deal here,2
i didnt try any of the chinese food the tacos were tasty but overpriced in my book i wouldnt come here again,1
1,0
open till 10 every night the white chocolate mousse is great tcby still holds its own  even against yogurtland tcby you sob,3
one of the top 3 clubs in vegasnnthe place is pretty nice but they have the best djs from all over plus monday nights are free for locals,4
hottest club in vegas probably too hot literally the hip hop room was so packed and sweaty you cant move,1
came here on monday night  heard lots of good reviews  their hip hop room is very small  not a lot of good music was playing compared to vanity  the pool area was packed the main room was the best place to be  a mixture of house electronic  hip hop  packed as well  the library sucks,2
gorgeous space indoor and out but the whole stairs thing just kills it,2
marquee y u so pretentious,1
overrated overpriced would not go again,0
stopped by marquee for the armin van buuren concert during edc weekend and it was extremely nice the stage area and dance floor is rather small but the light show and effects really make up for it if you can find your way out there overall i definitely much preferred marquee over tryst and surrender,4
crazy lines but good thing we have vip passes to skip the madnessnnevery floor was crowded to dance and there were absolutely no seats to sit how can a girl in heels survivenngreat music though,2
what a freaking joke this place is they dont let guys in if the ratio isnt perfect or if you dont have the perfect shirt never will i recommend  i hate vegas and its bullshit like this,0
went to the dayclub wasnt impressed may have been how awesome encore was the day before but none the less seemed nowhere near on the same level daybeds cabanas were very cramped barely had room to walk between rows of beds,2
i had only been to the poolside before but went to the club for the first time the bouncers were actually friendly making sure there was enough space to walk around the sound system here is amazing fun to see some great djs nntwo floors to the nightclub  the one upstairs is a lot larger,3
one of my fave clubs in vegas  they always have great djs performing  gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe,3
we were less than welcomed at the door the security guard was extremely disrespectful we would not have gone in if our birthday bud didnt insist,2
first class service and the best seafood on the strip  you definitely get what you pay for here  loved the food and experience  chef josh is a great guy as well,4
lunch in las vegas does not have the power element like most other cities as everyone is on vacation milos on the other hand has become my favorite new lunch restaurant to eat and be seen with an amazing prefix menu this is the spot to be,4
food is amazing but you do pay for it so bring your big credit card  wonderful service beautiful restaurant and you cant get fish any more fresh than milosnnhighly recommend the grilled octopus appetizer i still dream about it,4
very good food very expensive and limited choices not a traditional greek restaurant very expensive but good,3
just wanted a small cup of coffee  maybe it was old but ph was low enough to etch metal  the soy milk they added curdled upon impact  i had one sip and tossed it immediately  i wont go back  where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink,0
great location in new scottsdales newer retail shopping center decent coffee,2
this store is pretty cool and is a great location for street shopping also had some really cool gift ideas and great for visitors but went in there specifically for arrowheads and they hand none i feel like thats such a common thing for this area they should have that,2
hit or miss  foods not the freshest but its not that bad  really cheap and big portions,2
the name is as good as the food you can go in and take out you can sit down and get served and if your close enough they will deliver it a mom and pop asian food place with all or your favorite taste liker teriyaki and orange chicken worth a stop and food is always great,3
the food is good margarita is good but a bit weak getting something better than the house may be different all together a good experience,2
professional friendly staff  dr adaoag is very receptive and knowledgeable  comfortable office  most comfortable doctor visit ive had in vegas thus far,4
come here quite often never disappoints service is much to be desired but the food makes up for it,3
bad service but the food was okay,2
this was a great little place to grab dinner in a hurry service was prompt and polite the food was good but you cant go too wrong with pho it was a good portion for the price 8 for a regular bowl  id love to go back try the other menu items,2
jimmy johns is the best  the bread is always super fresh and chewy the have super fast service and delivery and i mean super fast  my sandwich was ready before i was done ordering  definitely go there,4
terribly slow drive thru and they always make my drinks wrong great location and a few nice baristas but they dont make up for a poorly made 5 latte id rather go out of my way to sbucks on trop and fort apache,1
emily afternoon shift had horrible customer service i havent been much of a complainer but im tired of people getting away with horrible customer service skills if you cant treat everyone with respect try another job,0
this is a relatively small location for future reference ill stick to drivethru but ive never had a problem so no complaints,3
i love your subs  but i went in there and saw many flies  so i kindly told the worker  i was not ordering because of all the flies and walked out ekk gross,0
i dined here on monday 0429 i ordered the korean steak tacos they were ok but nothing special the vanilla bean cheesecake however was good the waitress young lady long blond hair was very good and attentive,3
cardboard crust canned sauce nothing special but if youre starving and only have 2 in your pocket this will tide you over nothing more,0
not exactly sure how they pulled this off but yeah its legit nyc pizza,4
pabst on tap good fresh pizza great prices,2
the 4 star rating is not for the pizza alone which is pretty good not the best i have ever had but still very very decent especially the white but rather for the secret factor the location and just the fun it involves getting there also the cosmo is one of my favorite casinos on the strip,3
not cheap  450 for a cheese slice and 24 for a whole pie but definitely tasty even when youre not that hungry so that says something lol  will definitely try other menu items next time i return,3
pizza plus video games and pinball super delish pizza with fresh crust and hot bubbly cheese simpy divine a little pricey but well worth it if you are in the cosmopolitan and  want great pizzastop by herennthin crust also,4
pricy but not so much compared to other things on the strip and it tasted pretty good,3
i have no idea why there was such a huge hype it was just a typical thin crusted pizza seriously the toppings were good pepperoni sausage etc but honestly you can get a better pizza elsewherennhowever if you are dying for a late  night snack after marquee its conveniently located,2
came in at 1pm on a sunday if i wanted premade reheated pizza i could have gone to sabaros and not waited in line there are too many great places in vegasdont waste your time here,0
love this place  its a definite must every time im in vegas  i always get the whole pie half white sauce and half red sauce with sausage simple but amazing  nnmy tips takes about 30 minutes or so for a whole pie so dont come starving,4
pretty good for 3am pizza knocked off a star because the slices were sweating off oils probably because we ordered all of the meats crust is on the thin side would come back when craving pizza in vegas,3
fun atmosphere hidden holeinthewall friendly employees pepperoni and meatball pizza was awesome,3
if i had 30 dollars left and i had a choice of buying a pizza pie or going to marquee i would choose the pizza life everyday shoutout to the grandmas out there nnthis place is spot for a pricey oily slice of indulgent vegas goodness,4
loved this place i went two nights in a row after the club pizza is great but the only drag was the wait and its on the 3rd floor on the opposite site of the pool tables btw,4
if youre from ny youll know this pizza is average at bestnni guess people from everywhere else dont have the same reference pointnnthat being said its a solid late night option with good choices it is a bit pricey,2
one of the best pizzas ive tried italian and sicilian pizza highly recommended if u like cheese pizza try their white pizza bomb,4
great pizza very friendly staff slices are very big and you can add additional toppings to their already made pizzas cool find   grab a slice a glass of wine and walk out front to the sofas by the pool table,4
nothing special just typical fast greasy pizza 3 stars because its open late    no regular seating fyi,2
i agree with the 3 star  aok  healthy choice at airport  expensive but filling bento box to go at 14  had several little roll pieces 3 sushis and some seaweednnehbut better than a burger and fried,2
overpriced and mediocre quality sushi they crank the rolls out very fast so thats goodbut also bad because theyre not put together too well,1
comment dire la du00e9coration il ny en a pas ou peu disonsneffectivement le poisson est frais et cuit devant soi mais estce de la grande cuisine hum non cu00e9tait lourd u00e0 manger pourtant le prix qui ne fait pas sourire aurait laissu00e9 sous entendre que cela aurait u00e9tu00e9 meilleur,0
great location great environment and great food oxtail fried rice and pork rib are strongly recommended,4
fried chicken bananas,4
ordered a regular tuna roll and there was a bone in it the tuna itself was not that good either this place is very pricey and not great i would recommend going somewhere else,0
let me just keep it simple popos should be named poopoosnthe only people that could possibly enjoy this food is someone very intoxicated,0
saturdays and tuesdays are 1 margarita daysnoh and the food is really good too,4
we tried it and liked it  i thought it was better than most  traditional mexican food and plenty of seafood options  or at least more than most  its always crowded and was recommended to us by an arrowhead resident,3
come hungry because you get a lot the food was delicious and the salsa tasted fresh i think we found our new mexican restaurant home,4
really wanted to like this place but the food was so so service was fine sat at the bar but when they get busy there seems to be a lot of work placed on to one person while a lot of other workers stand around pretty pricy,1
watered down iced coffee and stale donuts,0
i could not find a coffee bar one morning and stumbled upon this place it was crowded but the line moved fast they have so many selections of munchies teas and coffee i was very pleased with it regular priced for vegas,4
hate going to the dentist this place has been awesome though everyone is extra friendly and polite they all take time to explain things fully no shadiness helpful payment plans too,4
great location  total eye candy,2
service is a bit slow factor that in if you are stopping for a quick drink before a movie,2
service at the bar area is hit or miss we had two bartenders waiting on us  one made our drinks and delivered in record time  we ordered a few apps and an entree the apps all came but they completely forgot our entree  after an hour of waiting we decided to leave,2
i went here in a saturday afternoon and i have to say it was a mistake nnthe beer was stale soapy and flat the food was bad and our waitress was just slow nni have nothing positive to say about the comedy club,0
open late not too expensive by vegas standards usually no wait inside our hotelnwe ate here too much during our stay because it was so convenientnthe food was ok the service was good calm atmosphere nid eat here again but mostly because its quick when my blood sugar is low,2
great environment and service if anything was wrong with our plate ex undercooked steak it was quickly replaced and re plated as if we had gotten a whole new plate the waiters couldnt have been nicer,4
nothing special  a bit overpriced for what you are getting but what do you expect at a restaurant on the stripnntater tots were okay but ive had better  beet salad was a winner,2
food is good  not one of my first picks when in vegas but if i was staying at the cosmo again and didnt feel like leaving the hotel this would be a good option,2
the food was good we liked the refillable sparkling water bottle the server was very casual and border line annoying laughed at our order and made us feel uncomfortable the lights from the bar next door were really bright and annoying overall it was an ok experience,2
we wanted this place to be great and well it just isnt if you are coming for food find another spot if you get the right seat and you can see the happening casino at least you know what you are paying for next time ill gamble with my money not with my food,1
average food with an average menu,2
this is the heart of las vegasflashing neon lights hotels shopping restaurants the gorgeous bellagio fountain womenmen passing out porn fliers and everything else imaginable can be seen on the strip let me warn you it is a bch trying to get from one end of the strip to the other due to traffic,3
great service and great quality food  nnthe continental breakfast was delicious and plentiful,4
the buffet is limited for the price if u have car venture to m casino studio b breakfast or lunch buffet m th for a good deal theren the waiterserver was top notch food was okay nothing to write home about or worth the wait will not return,1
if you like olives you have to get the fried olives stuffed with sausage  i had the braised short rib and it was fabulous hearty and fork tender  giving 3 stars because the prosciutto pizza was not that great  just needed to be cooked a little longer and not enough flavor,2
patio seating is lovely,2
its a very difficult task to stand out along the crowded waterfront the few times ive been have been great but not quite great enough to take time away from its neighbors   the concept is there and i will continue to patronize it in search of a fifth star and some more fingerling potatoes,3
i drove by 2 breakfast joints on scottsdale rd on sat am and the wait was 25mins  then it dawned on me that the herb box was in old town  yeah  we walked right in we were seated  what a great place cozy and great patio and the food was great as always,4
this is my favorite restaurant in old town hands down great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when its too hot i have never ordered something i didnt love,4
worst food got sick on the gross egg dish there was also hair in the food  too noisy and cold will not go here again  had guests and they were disappointed also,0
i love this spa  it is fantastic francesca and barb are very professional the atmosphere is classy  clean theyve got a client for life,4
great value for money recently renewed and so really clean as well staff was friendly nthe room had bad ventilation and smelled like bleach when arrivednthe ac was noisy and didnt feel really effective ncontinental breakfast is not worth mentioning,2
hovering between 3 and 2 stars great look to this place but as many others have said the drinks are bit priceynn i found the servers pretty abrupt as well,2
this place had tons of great looking food  i ran straight to the sushi to start  it was slammin  i liked everything i ate  it will take me a few visits to get to everything that i wanted to try  the place was clean all the food looked fresh  i will be going back again,4
get the jack mac very good went for lunch get the bowl if youre hungrynndefinitely go back,3
ultimate hot dog spot ive had a couple deluxe rippers and the pork tacos here and theyre all crazy good im usually not a big hot dog fan but it was hard not to try an island dog when the opportunity presents itself plus bird songs mexi cali on tap puts this spot over the top for me,4
slow service staff needs more training theres like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i dont think this place is going to make it sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons saturday night because of your poor customer service,0
amazing food and champagne  one of the best selections of champagne i have ever seen  the sunday brunch is excellent make sure you show up for that  we went for dinner and had a wonderful experience  as it got later in the evening the place got louder and more crowded,3
i went here for the food and it was horrific i guess i did it wrong because i didnt get champagne or tea i got coffee lol it was pretty good coffee though but the breakfast burrito sucked a lot of food but gross on to the next one,1
now that pop soda shop is gone this is the next best place to go i guess  they have a good selection of soda and candy and some toys  i wish they had the dublin dr pepper but they dont,2

good food  service started fast until they got busy kinda short staffed waited forever to pay  fyi they dont take amex cards,2
we stopped in for dinner at about 730 one evening wo other tables of customers yet it took almost 10 minutes for the waitress to get to us then another 10 minute wait to get our drinks then more waiting to order our food seems to have taken forever to get our food which was mediocre at best,1
customer service here is the worst  dont even bother ordering ahead of time because they wont have your order or any record of your order although i really like the food here i wont be back  2 strikes is all it takes for me,0

ive been here twice for happy hour the drinks are fine pricewise and the food is ok  too greasy in some cases i would come here again if the service were better the first time we got a waitress with an attitude and the second time the waitress apparently had better things to do than her job,1
my buddy and i have been there a few times its a good location thats about it the happy hour food is subpar drink prices are alright its usually pretty open so thats why we go there then again with the poor food and lackluster service that could be why,1

its gross in herecobwebs hanging off the lamps and tables r filthyand how does a sandwich spot run out of wheat breadand very wierd tht there r pictures of wierd looking kids everywhere,0
the sales approach at this place is nothing short of a used car lot  three gentlemen fought over shaking my hand as i walked through the door and everything went downhill from there,0
this seems to be a busy location at least during lunch time service was prompt and employees were cordial,3
ive been here only once and really enjoyed this place  i shared the baby back ribs and rib stew with my friends  we were all moaning anf groaning from the savory goodness  this is really awesome comfort food  also they have some of my favorite wines on their list  just what i need after a long day,3

i am really impressed with not just coffee i consider myself very judge mental about my coffee and this place definitely went beyond my expectations im definitely ordering a cup to go mocha latte did not disappoint,4
not a good start my appointment wasnt in their system and despite being told they could get me in right away the about an hour needed to look over my car is now pushing 105 minutes otherwise they verified what a different shop told me and their prices were about the same,2

little caesars  wait its not ready  i dont why this particular location never has pizzas ready  thats the whole point of going to little caesars right  you go in give them 5 and walk right back out with a pizza  its really not worth waiting for in my opinion,0
super greasy really cheap prices but somehow they still retained some quality in the food the pizzas here are pretty good i wouldnt ever crave them but i wouldnt be opposed to going here if someone suggested itnnthe brownies are really good,2
do yourself a favor and enjoy some pork buns at umami,3

this is my favorite thai restaurant in clt i love the pad thai and shrimp rolls the food is fresh service is excellent and location 5 minutes from home whats not to love about it,4
tried it a few times but last time i had the soup  it was stale and made me sick waste of money,0
this place is so small from the inside i would hardly call it a club not worth it,0
got there early it was realy dead im sure if the night were to continue on it may have gotten beter but we left music was nothing really to remember might give it a second chance next time im out there,1
would not recommend to anyone we went on a friday night and this place was practically empty maybe due to the bad music they had some good songs but mostly just crap not worth going to really,0

sandwich was good but the fries were horrible there are so many good places to get a quick bite to eat in vegas i would skip this as a meal place did not have dessert but those looked pretty good,1
dined here for lunch twice in the last two months it is super cute and the food is fantastic be prepared to pay a bit more and wait a little longer it is not a sit down eat and leave quickly type of place definitely split a goblet with two or three people since it is 36 each,3
if you could give zero stars i would  seated on a wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat then sat then sat some more  apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes,0
if you come to vegas this is a must for drinks but i would pass on the food tried almost everything on the food menu and its not impressive at all the goblets on the other hand are amazing and a must try my favorite was the gummy goblet so yummy  fun,2
expensive glorified bar food and crappy server the view was great though right across the bellagio fountains be fair warned food is mediocre they need to really fix this place up how disappointing,0
hamburgers and onion rings  the bomb  they are good  service  cant say much for that  first time service was not good at all  second visit service was better but they messed up our orders  tortillas soup  1000  very brothy not much else in it  perfect place for burgers and onion rings,2

awesome placenndecor is rad feels like im at someone house in japan for eats and just about everything off the menu is delish i return often,4
pretty weak experience here  food is all bland and boring  spend 100 for two people here and i cant really remember what it went to  the yellowtail collar was dry and bland  the chowanmushi was gooduni too  service is good here i must say though but wen only went here because ichiza was packed,2
this place was great i have nothing to complain about happy hour menu great service great food thats all im really looking for when i go out to eat i wish i snapped some pictures of my food open late great place to stop and get a bite late at night,4

best pho ever,4

come for the beer not for the food,1
i dont like giving 5s so a 4 nice to have a guinness and a guinness stew wife had a sheppards pie and was happy should use real mash potatoes servings on the large size the fish and chips could help feed the 5000 for vegas not bad value good selection of beers,3
perfect hotel for phoenix they are as  racist as arizona is ngood job westin keeping it real for az   nyou should change your publicity  only white people allow,0
40 for a cup of gumbo jambalaya a pepsi and tip very very spicy to the point of overwhelming any flavor jambalaya was a bit salty and greasy with dried out chicken definitely not worth 23 i wont be rushing back any time soon,1
service was good but food was tasteless  called in advance to ask if they had a bloody mary bar and was told yes  upon arrival we were told it was offered only on holidays  dissapointed,0

cappuccino was undrinkable it was burnt and made me want to cry ive found that some barristas at one coffee co know what theyre doing and others dont,1
every time i head to abc cake supply i see this wonderful store on the way i often say i need to stop there today i did it is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items from baby wedding kitchen and on i picked up some of their mini cupcake stands love,4
the food was good portions huge and there was a good variety on the menu  however it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food even though the place wasnt full  so worth it for the food quality and portions but be prepared for a long wait to get it,2
the service was great the staff was friendly the food wasnt bad but it wasnt good didnt have much flavor i wouldnt recommend this place as the food really isnt all that great,1
run of the mill bar with dirty floors and extremely loud music,0
went here on two nights where it was pretty empty on both nights but walked by sat night and saw so many people out on the patio wonder if it was carrie underwood fans or something since she had just performed nearby,1
this bruggers suffers from very poor customer service the manager had a terrible attitude i thought she might even quit her job when i asked for a cup for water who wants to start their day like this even the 16 year old kids at mcdonalds are much nicer in the morning,1
this airport doesnt have a lot of good food options but would consider this place one of the better options if you have some time to kill  typical airport prices and okay bar food but good service,2
food is random management scarce its a so so  place only survives because they offer sports to view while you eat food you couldve prepared at home,1
good hotel for the price huge rooms everything is stained but to be expected by the strip bring your own everything they dont even provide shampoo overall good for the price,2

great performances and acts the main guy was hilarious and the space was intimate i only wish angel had a larger part but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element nnps the absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas i appreciate that they had it though,3
best show ever  the prior description of borat meets cirque du soleil is quite accurate  front row is well worth it  so long as you dont mind being part of the show,4
the most amazing show ive ever seen burlesque meets gymnastic meets comedy  i would see absinthe over and over theres no bad seat in the house it was so close and intimate must see in vegas,4
raunchy but well worth it one of the best shows i have seen on the strip dont miss this one,4
best show that i have seen in vegas combination of comedyacrobatics and singing definitely recommend watching this,4
the show was insane fun times dont go if you are easily offended spectacular mustsee show ive see many shows in vegas and this was one of the best i laughed so hard my face hurt  seats are unassigned and not very comfortable but who cares you will be on edge all the time anyway,3

445 for hammond lollipops that are 199 at whole foods what a rip and teenage clerks being too familiar and inappropriately jokey in front of me me thinks not,0

came in waiter was alright gave me a stair like i didnt know what i was doing he gave mediocre service im full,2
this was my first time at ayce sushi and i got to say it was bombdizzle for 33 dinner i nearly passed out by our third round however after some wiggling shifting and fresh air i recovered and continued to go ham on them yellow tails this is well worth your 33 just make sure you do legs beforehand,4
this is my go to sushi spot when im in vegas absolutely love it here the food is really fresh all the time the hostess arpi is really awesome shes very nice and chill and remembers all the regulars see you next time im in town,4

what a scam the owner hates groupon so he has the nerve to mark mine redeemed although i never used it i wonder how many other unsuspecting people dont even realize this i will never go there again and will be reporting this to groupon,0
the food is great but no more steak on the menu thats why i gave it 3 stars,2
crab blt was a big disappointment  why did they chop the bacon into little pieces which kept falling off the sandwich  crab cakes had little flavor  mac cheese was ordinary  overpriced considering the lack of quality,1
great place im glad that we pull over here at a right place where we eat our dinner with a cool interior design that will add to your appetitennthe price is also cheaper than the othersnncheck this out,3
tried their half soup and salad soup was a very hearty chili and beans  this was more like a bowl than a cup the soup was like a stew tried their salad with fruits apples and pears  interesting blend,3
nice area quiet 3 separate playgrounds 2 for my toddler thats safe enough with safety swings and no sand which is always great open grass areas too covered picnic area so its a good place to have a play date,3
not bad but good either and at 9 per sandwich there are much better places to go service is spotty as well nice folks but they have some work to do,0
very clean fresh toppings,4
spent too long explaining my order correcting the cashier while the manager yelled to the back our order incorrectly then we still did not get our order as asked only one of the two soda fountains worked with a low ice machine none of the tables were clean,0
not very good edible but not good i could go into details but why ive had great mexican food in cali and this is not even close,1
while the chain is really good at inexpensive good tasting hamburgers this franchise seems to get away with servers that are unpleasant instructive and actually aggressive hamburgers that are barely cooked and a messy bathroomnntakeout of a well done burger is probably the best way to go here,0
terrible terrible service bland food dirty seating area,0
just back from lunch  first time at famous daves  im not a bar b q person but thought we would give it a try was it great service was top of the line to match the food will be back for more the ribs melt in your moutha must try,4
the btl sandwich is okay the bread is from home if you like how your mother make sandwich then okay i think the bread fatter,2
big mistake ordering delivery from this place and the pizza was not good costco or pizza heaven has better tasting pizza and for a whole lot less never again,1
got there right at opening time and seated at the bar area where the bartender was our waiter   he was so distracted he forgot to place our order  one hour later the pizza came out you have to eat it with a fork because its soupy not an enjoyable experience,1
this is my coffee place should be open later,4
i got my hair extensions at rejoice your beautiful renee obrien is the absolute best in az,4
lavazza coffee no more illy was excellent with my eggs benedict and homefry cakes   which by the way were loaded with feta onions and spinach a little pricey but would do it all over again,3
i love this location but the inside was crowded and other customers bumped me as they walked by im used to the baristas asking for my name after i place an order and this time they didnt ask for my name and someone almost walked off with my drink oh hell nah,1
too bad this place is now closed  they had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks they will be missed,0
im so happy to have found this place great food for cheap,4
after getting in at 500am i stumbled down to the cafe to grab something quick i was sat down omar was my waiter and suggested the lobster eggs benedict i am so glad i took him up on his suggestion my dish was the best breakfast i have ever eaten bombcom so amazing,4
this place is overpriced and service is slow they served breakfast potatoes which seemed like frozen potatoes and when we asked the waiter he did say it is frozen pancakes were too thick and felt doughy nntheir mexican breakfast items are way tastier,2
fyi the prices listed on the menu linked to this profile are lower than what is on the menu at the restaurant the burgers average about 50 and higher the hickory loaded for example is really 979 otherwise great food,3
meh i was not impressed overall it was just too crowded to play the games people kept bumping into each other,2
i thought this place was pretty cool old school arcade games and a bar its a pretty good combination,2
my favorite bar in vegas the staff is awesome atomosphere is always fun and the owners take care of locals best place to hang out,4

pool was ok to lounge by but no shade whatsoever nnmy problem was the service of this place specifically a man named salvador that i ran into a couple times by the pool ordering drinks from the bar he was a miserable old man and i suggest if you see him to ask for someone elses help,0
it was okay not as good as most pools in vegas there are a lot of kids the drinks were expensive but strong this pool is similar to the stratosphere pool in looks and overall pool quality i wouldnt go again but it was fun one time,2

this location is hard to get to if you are not familiar with the area but they are very helpful and fast to get you in and out  my friend needed access to a large sum of money that he couldnt pull from an atm so we drove to this location and were able to get help  thanks nfcu,4

the noodles were bland i ordered the noodles with steak and my friend ordered the curry noodles  both were bland  the prices were good and the service was friendly but this place was not worth going back to especially since its in the same shopping square as monta,1
fast and cheap tasty food i like the chicken curry over rice for only 495  also the mango pudding for dessert is delicious and only 125 i came here because monta was a ridiculously long wait and it ended up being great,3
as good as chinese food youll find in vegas with each dish for about 495 to 7 one cant go wrong the decor is bare basics but a terrific cheap eats with great hainan chicken,4
waste of money  had a great salesman on the phone who sold me into everything i would geti asked very specific questions to make sure i was picking a place to fit my needs  they have fancy machines but are completely unhelpful  i give them a zero out of 5,0
awesome coffee  awesome setting  very attentive staff  good food  perfect sunday morning spot,4

visit here several times a year the food is always fresh and well stocked they have sushi and several seafood items for their dinner buffet the staff is always efficient as well,4
disgusting  if you go into the kitchen you will never eat at this place  dirty dirty dirty,0
the fish on the sushi gave my friend food poisoning worse part is the manager is literally watching you from the cameras in the back nnthe worst part is that if you order more of the same sushi they reduce the fish portion and increase the rice amount i only tasted sticky rise,0
we went for a quick drink and dinner  had a salad and my husband had the fish and chips  overall the food was good drinks were on special and the service was friendly  great atmospherelots of locals,3

groupon users beware this salon figures you are one time customer nthe stylist they assigned to me washed my hair as if she was on a time limitnthe conditioner that was in included with the groupon was applied and not nwashed out and we all know what that means greasy looking hair,0
went out to try this place out today pulled the door handle and the door was locked peeked inside the half of the ceiling lights were on and the tables were in dissaray and without a chair insite more than likely this place went out of business,0
these donuts were the bomb i had eaten one and a half donuts before i knew what was happeningi was in heaven of course i went with chocolate but i had part of the buttermilk donut which is to die for got to check this place out i just wish they had one in my state,4

my experience in red wok is okay when i say okay i mean is not the restaurants fault they hired such a clumsy busser but anyways the food is great everything looks clean bathrooms outside  etc talking about the busser she was kind of rude but at the end she deserve nothing but a 0 tip,2
the place was super busy maybe that is why our food was really cold seemed like chicken was cold but the cheese was warm fries were completely cold i would have loved to wait a little more for a better warmer meal,1
the restaurant is kind of dirty the service is ridiculously slow and the food is not good youre better off going to mcdonalds,1
we have eaten take out many times from here and the food tastes pretty good orange chicken is good but not the best nthe curry is really delish,3
i like their coffee and i am happy to support a locally owned establishment good product and fair prices thanks for opening it,4
they do a pretty good job but honestly the blond woman who i believes owns the place is pretty rude and not very friendly next time i plan to drive a bit farther and go to cobblestone which actually is a little cheaper anyway,1
classy looking place its a large club with a nice wraparound patio bartenders were fast the price range is on the higher end of having a fun night on the town could definitely go other places to get more for your money this place seemed more about atmosphere and bottle service,2
this is the best burger i have had in a very long time  if you are craving a good burger you have got to try this place,4
i love this place they are always friendly the cheese curds are the best as well as the chicken tenders  this is one of my favorite restaurants in madison,4

a famous restaurant good service very juicy and tender steak while the beer collection is not so good almost only canned beers are available i just saw one beer tap there which is not on the menu,2
im not going to rehash whats been stated hear a billion times this place is solidnnbut due try to get a sunday brunch reservation about a month in advance the brunch menu is unique and unbelievable  skip the bloody mary bar and just get something off of the menu,4
la shis kabomb nncheapfreshexcellent flavorsnice people nnya just cannot beat it,3
went there today with 4 colleagues one of which is from jordan the food was hearty and delicious i suggest as a rule getting the special of the day or a couple of the sides the kunafa was delicious,4
this is some of the best food you will ever taste  the service is excellent no need to run down the list of their dishes i have had everything and its all done to perfection from the prices to the portions this guy knows how to treat a customer,4
located in red rock casino  hotel decent food obviously if you are in the hotel convenient location and open 24hrs,2
typical takeout chinese american style nice and clean inside husband tried the sesame chicken and said it was better than many he had tried wonton soup was ok nothing special ill be  back to try other things but i think two stars is sufficient most people would probably say its fine,1
my wife and i have recently ate here twice in the same week love the atmosphere great food prices are reasonable happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts oh the service was great as well,4
the peanut butter  jelly cake was served hot so the peanut butter was runny and the cake was really dry  hard you couldnt taste the jelly until you got into the center of the cake warm grape jelly isnt too great to eat the latte tastes like any other latte,1
i love red velvet cakes but the ones here were too dry its not even topped with cream cheese icing i do not recommend i also tried the blood mate tea it was okay the fruit yogurt parfait sucks too,0
the custard is good  we are always satisfied with the selection  i enjoy the root beer floats french fries and onion rings there,2
unfortunately not good todays visit was the last visit just not impressed with how greasy the beef is other dishes are ok nothing impressive enough for the price charged well i do like the custard so it might not be the last time,0
very tasty curry amazing fries and naan and i finally tried goat id definitely make another trip when we are on that side of town,3

just tried to check this one out based on yelp reviews but they were closed sunday morning 800 am bummer,0
quick and easy but i wouldnt say it was good more like to late to cook dinner super hungry deal with the quality place,1
same greatness as the location down the street but this one is a little roomier  nnking crab legs shrimp and corn still the best  nnif you got a big group i would probably try this one first,4
such a disappointment after being a regular at boiling crab the staff were all good looking though d,2
it was a fun experience im not sure if id go back because seafood isnt really my thing service was alright but had to keep waiting for a water,2
the portions on shrimp appeared a little skimped this time around or it may be cc and be are giving bigger portions overall its as expected,2
this is the worst place to go crawfish was so small and dry crab legs had no taste it took them forever to make food as wellnbetter go seafood supermarket and buy some live crabs and boil them,0
went back to make sure the first time wasnt a fluke not at all by far the best pizza i have had in vegas the only reason for 4 stars is that i live on the west side and a bit of a drive for me but it is worth the drive wish there was one on the west side,3
the ice cream is so rich and creamy they make the ice cream homemade at the stand so it is really fresh,4
great for fast food  been here for lunch not a big choice chicken or chicken but its good,4
beersngood ones non tapnlots of themnnboobiesnfake onesnon the serversnmost of themnnoh yeah and music and comedy and food and stuff too,3
i love the strawberry fields martini,4
just ok  went in with coworkers good vibe decent band and fun crowd  ordered a few appetizers steak bites and wings  flavorless  ever salt chicken wings  if you go here  have a cocktail listen to tunes and skip the food,2
no no no no the bartenders were rude and looked miserable clearly they hate their jobs as much as i hated being there skip this place not worth it,0
i came here once and was instantly confused by the menuis this custard or italian ice i picked a coffee flavored custard slushee and it tasted bad like chemically flavored crushed ice maybe im one of those people who picked the wrong thing but i would definitely go to tasty yo over this place anyday,1
the staff is always friendly  the green tea was great the last time i got it  this saturday i got an orange pineapple spritzer and it was absolutely fantastic,4
waited 40 minutes for two sandwiches hamburger that my husband got was the frozenthenheated up kind my chicken ciabatta was over done and dry waitress was nice i think problem is with kitchen two sandwiches and two drinks came to close to 50 what a rip off will not be back,0
the customer service in this store is terrible a manager by the name if justin was rude and sarcastic and needs a belt to hold his pants up if oreily thinks guys like justin are good managers than corporate has a poor judge of character and customer service,0
i have been impressed by autohausaz service their prices are great and all the parts that i have ordered where quality material exactly what their website have stated and the price is definitely the best  i just ordered a set of halo rotors they arrived within 2days,4
we went with high hopes we were seated and waited 20 minutes no exaggeration without anyone coming to our table we tried to get the attention of the waitress as she passed and she actually looked the other way i we ended up leaving without even being able to try it,0
my boyfriend and i dropped in for the first time on a sunday afternoon  the atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean  our server dan was knowledgeable and pleasant the food was average but good for the price we will definately be back,2
had a living social coupon so we could try this place  the edamame was overly salted  i kept wiping the salt off my fingers  we order a 3 fish sushi and spicy scallop roll  both were spicy and good  we would go again if in the area but there are other sushi places closer to us that we rave about,2
the restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group the salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful we had a variety of food tacos enchiladas and carne asada unfortunately the food was bland and not very good perhaps we caught the chef on a bad day,0
great company to work with very professional and knowing the right technique about local search marketing and search engine optimization nnthey really knows how to engage with audience and bring connection between customers and business highly recommend,4
ive had better but this one was good better than ive found so far in phoenix but it was a bit pricey for me and inconvenient that they only accept cash,2
came here because of the rating  food was average in taste and quality and pricey to boot  atmosphere is very basic at bestkind of like a run down college diner   on the plus side food was served almost instantly and the bbq sauce was tasty,1
why always such a long wait  and if waiting is forever long why install those most uncomfortable park bench staffs are awful  unhelpful  slow really,0
the flavors and toppings were okayni was a little disappointed how few nonfat options there werenthey have an okay selection but all were of similar tastes,1
i was excited to try this place but sadly i did not get a chance they advertise that they deliver but apparently only on busy days dont know which day that is very disappointed,0
its a beautiful salon but a mans haircut is 65,1
used a groupon yesterday and can only say that i had nothing negative to report and believe me where hair care is concerned i can be very critical i had a phase i student who carried me through the process in a very professional manner final words  excellent experience,4
not exceptional but not everyone cant be yogurtland service is good they have many toppings but the yogurt itself could be better my least favorite yogurt so far,1
average downtown thai restaurant nice for a quick workday lunch with peers  ok fresh hot thai food  nothing too special  would i go back  yes but there are other better optionsnnnote  they had a very brisk business on a thursday afternoon lunch dont be surprised to wait for a table,2
if you want waxing when in vegas this is the best place got a brazilianwax smooth as a baby very sanitary clean place  loved the friendly accommodating staff definitely going back thanks the birthday suit,4
decided to give this place a 2nd chance since i was in the area  needed a hard wax brazilian and i must say it was pretty darn good really not painful at all for a brazilian and super clean and speedy,3
food poisoned trip the hospital needless to say ill never be eating here again,0
update you guys dont server cold burritos anymore thanks  good food here they have a good 99 menu everyday,2
buyer beware they have raised the prices here again,2
ok for mexican food nhot chips were served nsalsa was good nordered chili rellano it was traditional style and tasted oknthe sauce was not what i expected but good nthe service was very good,2
food is good but customer service should be just as good very rude not friendly makes you feel un welcome dont know how he stays in business will tell all people i know to never go there vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them,0
this place is the bomb  a must when in vegas adobada and lengua are my favs the asada is nothing special,4
omg the best place ever cheap eats and bomb a food especially late night,4
wowthese are the best tacos i have ever eaten i ordered only 4 of the carne asada  tacos thinking id leave room for desserts on the strip but the hell with that they were sooooo good and pica i had to go back for more nnif you are anywhere near vegas you just have to stop here,4
maybe im too picky but after having eaten at the original place off of h street in san diego nothing comes even remotely close to it overall food was ok priced just right i say try it youll probably like it,2
it was ok kinda pricey for what you get its at the end of the strip so if your faded its good,1
best taco ive ever had in my life  period  the price is so far below the astronomical prices of the strip it isnt even funny  authentic friendly and excellent food quality make this place the best and one of the cheapest meals ive ever had in las vegas  bravo,4
most authentic tacos outside of mexico nnevertheless srgordo please fix your ordering system long lines ruin the experience,3
street tacos  fantastic you walk in the door and the grill smoke greets your nostrils and you begin to salivate service is fast and friendly food is fresh and delicious  and inexpensive a great option on the strip,4
yummy tacos open late people i ate there with last night are still raving about how good their food was have a variety of different meat to choose from,4
not as good as molly brannigans but a decent pub none the less,2
never again  ive been to numerous chiropractors and ive never walked out in this kind of excruciating pain i left in a neck brace  i communicated several times that it was hurting and he kept pushing  there are better more experienced chiropractors out there  dont make the same mistake i did,0
pretty good selection they dont sell hotdogs here and make sure you check the date on some of the beer,2
we couldnt have been more pleased with the service and the delicious food loved everything about this place great way to end a day of strolling around old town scottsdale perfect date spot,4
folks i will say it write it again this place is amazing the service is topnotch excellent food atmosphere and ambience always a great romantic time very professionally ran the staff is great and establishment is modern and clean highly recommended sexy,4
still sooooooo slow this store needs to take lessons from the dunkin donut stores back east where customer service is beyond excellent and the staff hustles,0

amazing burgers,4
outstanding nfrom san diego and needed a burger fix and boy did i get itnhad the beach house recommended by the guy at the counter and he was right onni will be back next time im in phoenix,4
amazing its way out of the way but totally worth it first time in there and customer service was excellent only complaint is serving size is a lil small great burgers and fries we will be back to try other items as well,3
they have a good variety on the menu from oven wood oven baked pizzas to osso bucco  try the mamma meatball slider to start  went on a saturday night it was busy so i can get noisy,3
the scene on columbus weekend was relaxed and uneventful  we did enjoy hanging out in the lounges watching tv and playing playstation 3 in between laying out and hitting the hot tub,2
tried the brisket the other day and it was excellent  juicy and tender its a definite reorder  they put the sauce on top next time ill ask them to put it on the side so i can just eat some brisket by itself,2
good food overall but the storefront could use some work to make for a nicer dining experience the place was clean and service was fine i would absolutely order take out or delivery from here,2
so heres latest  i received a message from the bbb this evening stating that they were unsuccessful at getting a response from filibertos  not sure what the next step is but i am not finished,0
ann was very professional while i was standing there practically or totally naked  she made me feel very comfortable and always offered me the best deal possible  i had never had a spray tan before and visited her multiple times,3
i had a great cupping and deep tissue massage with elliot he was very professional and listened to what i wanted him to work on the atmosphere was very soothing and it smelled fantastic the price is cheap considering the care and great service im planning on being a regular customer,4
the stacys on shea is closed,0
good service  and they had decaf coffee ready not instant or lattes only like most mtl places toast was excellent but the eggs potatoes  and pancake were just ok fruit was laughable more like garnish,1
this is located in the blakeney shopping center ordered the chicken gyro combo comes with drink and fries for 275 more i think the gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce i get the lemon and oregano fries also yummy nice people good food at a reasonable price,3
we love going there for their gyros and also the lamb burgers dont miss the fries without a doubt the best in all of charlotte,4
they are saving money by doing the first coat of polish with some crappy off brand in a similar color the polish looks really bad the impurities in the crappy polish are showing not recommended,0
decent food ordered the sicilian pizza not knowing what it really was the crust was super crunchy i was hoping for doughy place is really nice inside and the service was good  huge portions i dont think ill return just wasnt for me but is worth a try,1
i am a fan of russos  tried the pizza many times and it was very good for vegas   i tried the wings and they were cooked to perfection  recommend this pizzeria,3
good food great prices,2
not the best atmosphere but the eggplant szechuan over noodles made it worth coming its no longer available look at your reviews several times this particular dish is mentioned with pics taken why would you remove it from your menu,1
very poor service we had to repeat our order at least 4 times and they still got the order wrong they where very slow,1
needed a tux for prom because im a last minute guy and this place was perfect great quick service the guys here take the initiative to get anything you need or anything you want to change in the words of arnold schwarzenegger ill be back,4

compared to the palazzo this caesars store is much bigger in terms of their display cases so my gf got to try on and see whats in season,4

the egg pizza is the bomb  also awesome garlic fries and a great chopped salad  everyone we recommended the egg pizza to loved it,4
i was needing pizzas for a customer as close to 11am as possible i called around to 5 other pizza places who had no interest in helping me i called them and told them my predicament and they were more than willing to help me not to mention their pizza was very good thank you,3
they are ok  tried to step out of the box  got the bananapeanut butter no good cake wasnt fresh  only ate half of it  will make sure i ask which ones are the freshest   hope that the other flavors are ok,1
i really enjoyed the show wasnt anything crazy but jan rouven was great he was very funny the only down side is how they cram you in there the seats could be moved a little bit far apart overall the show was good and i would see it again when family comes to town,3
large beef burrito with homemade tortilla was great  tacos were filled with fresh beef cheese onions lettuce  tomatoes served w a side of beans and rice we all had soft drinks and the bill was under 20  friendly service and the bathrooms are clean  ps margaritas are a 100 off on fridays,4
went here before the foo fighters last night the place was crowed and not staffed at all i was waiting at the bar for 20mins and the bartender never came to our side this place cant handle big events downtown stay away,0
ive been to other tilted kilt locations before so i knew what to expect  my girlfriends fries were undercooked  our server seemed a bit ditsy and took a long time to check in on us  it wasnt a terrible experience but it wasnt great either  id say skip this location,1
ive been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time the staff is good but the food is not the lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink i prefer twin peaks over tilted kilt now,1
eww food was horrible  only reason i gave it 1 star was because the fries were decentnneww never again,0
dont be fooled charlotte doesnt seem to have much to compare im a tough critic because im from the west coast not that great,1
i have been here twice for lunch and both times were great large portions and fast service the service was good but not great but that shouldnt stop you from having a good meal,3
we had big j come out to confirm that we had a slab leak  he was ontime and professional  and hes going to end up saving us  since i didnt even think to involve our insurance company,3
best chicken in pittsburgh  better than wings over pittsburgh and ugly dog  great service,4
got the veggie burger which was probably 98 salt not goodnnthe boyfriend liked the wings though and there were lots of tvs if i go back it will be for a beer not for the food,0
worst mistake of my life id give it 0 stars if i could these are the worst students ever im sure id be more comfortable having a monkey work on my teeth,0
a great atmospherena really good selectionnhorrible service,2
arizona bowl is great  teenage boys claim the best teryiyaki chicken in the valley,4
sushi was just okay,1
reasonably priced and decent portions  the decor was a bit confusing a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off tenayadoesnt quite fit the neighborhood  food was pretty tasty,2
lobster roll implies it is served on a roll not a piece of white bread similar to wonderbread respect the lobster respect yourself nnplus it is too pricey for what youre getting not into it,0
weve seen this place back home in houston tx but had never been our daughter took us while in town and i absolutely loved the home brew had the maui pork chop and it was very tasty but the red potatoes that it came with so very dry but the fresh green beans definitely made up for it,3
wonderful way to get around maddy and for 1000 you can ride as much as you like just have to check in the bike now and then during the 24 hour period we didnt drive the rental car once during our stay,3
as a recent transplant from chicago i was looking for a great handyman and chris is just that hes thoughtful funny and very thorough id hire him again in an instant and recommend him to anyone needs a hand,4

man i went there today and wow  i personally loved this placeit reminded me of a few cafes back home in dallas tx  if youre looking for a good breakfast placego to this place  you wont regret it,3
another great recommendation by our hotels concierge went here for sunday brunch it looked as though many people were waiting for tables but we were fortunately seated at a table for 2 within 5 minutes the service was great the omelettes were huge the meal was really delicious and filling,3
the poorest service i have experienced in montreal,0
good customer service however the prices are a bit costly however i do think they do a good job,2
yummy  offered to let us take some peanuts to gonnthe soda machines are awesome with 200 different types of soda combinations  one of the soda machines broke while we were there so took a little longer to wait for the other machine,3
ehhjust so so,2
just sadnordered online paid on line when i arrived at the pick up time they told me that their fax machine ran out of paper and they did not get my ordernni am now sitting in the dining room writing this review on my phone nnno attempt to make this right nni hope the pizza is good,0
the tacos were greasy and unflavorful i was quite disappointed with my order there was also dirt on the floors and the people making the food didnt speak much english,2
we have new construction and are the first house on our street we have a gigantic mailbox at the end of our driveway but the mailman cant find it  this is getting totally ridiculous  how can we move in without mail service  no wonder so many people hate the usps,0
a very warm and welcoming feeling from the time you walk in till the time you leave   mayo takes the time to really understand how you feel and does a great job making you feel much better when you leave  if youve been wanting to try acupuncture this is the place to go,4
just started and i am thrilled incredibly relaxing experience i am recommending them to everyone i know who may be seeking alternative solutions,4
my caprese sandwich was decent but it took half an hour to get our food seems a bit much considering there were all of eight patrons in the whole place kind of pricy for a sandwich but im glad that theres a nonfast food lunch option in the area the outdoor seating is nice too,2
the teens who work here are quite rude wasnt expecting much for the few items i had but the service was terrible i was the only customer in the store when i walked in and they stayed behind the counter the whole time,0
what fantastic people met the general manager and she couldnt be more genuine not to mention helpful i had a question about the place she couldnt answer and she took my number and said she would find out and let me know gosh,4
they have great bands that play here  but its too small of a venue to hear music,2
the carne asada tacos were amazing reminded me of the ones in mexico only thing that killed this place for me was they forgot the side of rice my girlfriend ordered and when we finally received it the mexican rice was undercooked great in flavor just super crunchy,2
one of the finest dining experiences,4
beware they do not sanitize their tools  after they are done they put the tools back in the bag and seal it again so when the next customer comes in they think the tools are clean and unused  never coming back here again,0
it was about a 2 12 hour class for the adultchildinfant cpraed certification john did an excellent job teaching the class it was very informative it was only 40 i think the american ref cross charges twice as much,3
cute and convenient friendly service not sure about the hype croissant and espresso were just okay,2
lauretta was very helpful in educating me on skin care and was a pleasure to be around i would recommend her services to everyone in scottsdale,4
lauretta is great  not only is she sweet and personable but she is also very educated when it comes to skin  she also doesnt hesitate sharing the information with you to help you along your journey of obtaining great skin  in just 2 treatments my melasma is looking so much better all thanks to her,4
honestly nothing i have eaten here could even be considered average the service is always solid but the average beer selection and below average food make this place forgettable i now spend my time at the bulldog pub instead which has better food beer selection and atmosphere,1
i was a little skeptical about trying a froyo place because they are popping up all around the valley but when i stepped in here i knew this place was good they are very inviting and the atmosphere is relaxing i come in every time im in the neighborhood yummy flavors,4
foodnsandwiches are great pizzas are pretty good pasta is gummy and undercookednnatmospherenfun loud casualnnservicenstanding in lines is kind of fun and different and you get to watch your items as they are prepared self seating self pick up of food,1
went for dessert  drinks  bar service was a slow  desserts were meh  did like the location  that the front walls opened to the street but that isnt enough to get me to go back too many other great options around the area to settle for meh,1
its good yogurt to get your sugar fix but its not the best that i have tasted i love how it looks inside though and the name is quite cute,2
great experience with these guys professional quick and very affordable i highly recommend you hire them if you need sprinkler help,4
yummy food good service,3
the quality has dropped from our last 2 visits shrimp were old and mushy what a shame i really enjoyed this place,1
i love how there are a variety of menu options here vs hot n juicy and their cajun sause is so uniqueits tasty and delicious  the service here is wonderful as they are always upbeat happy polite and care about your dining experience,4
i will use this company again in a heartbeat gerald was great the guys who came out and did the repairs were friendly and knowledgeable they helped me find a way to keep the cost down a service,4
found these guys using bing my iphone home button was unresponsive brought it in and less than 30 minutes i was up and running brand new home button installed works better now than it did when it was new,3
four for dinner on sat nite  prime rib salmon caesar liver and onions and mahi mahi  each was very good service was very fine  we like this place,3
i ordered the italian club and it was decent but underwhelming the bread was dense and tasty but it wasnt the largest hoagie ive had should have gone with the full size bec the half was not enough,1
so so yogurt and with one on every corner you really have to make yourself stand out i thought the kid behind the counter was friendly and helpful the toppings and yogurt selections are once again so so does anyone else find it odd this business is categorized under ethiopian food,2
my time is short so i will be brief the food is great here the waitress i had was friendly however the prices are too high for people like myself who have to watch their spending,2
while the food here was good i am just not a fan of the long line the packed atmosphere and the tight quarters just dont feel like i had any personal space and made me feel a bit stressed out and rushed i would suggest coming here for breakfast however i highly recommend to avoid the busy hours,1
the food is good would give 4 starts except  i guess somewhere along the line i became an old man but something about 10am shoulder to shoulder with tons of people and techno from the dj if you have a hangover avoid,2
also be sure to check out the reviews that are not recommended by yelp  all say the same thing,0
i love going to dutch brothers everybody there is so nice and genuinely seems to care about how youre doing the coffee is great my kids love the junior mafia drink selection we go there about twice a week but this location is my favorite,4
took a buddy to lunch here last month  surprised to get there around 1130 and be the only ones there  the food was great as was the service  looking forward to my next meal here the next time i pass through phoenix,3
guiltfree guilty pleasure great for those days when you want to eat something delicious without feeling greasy after i had one of their paninis and and loved it i wish they stayed open a little later,3
very clean fast service very nice employees and good subs,3
excellent selection of pastries including chocolate almond croissants  nnboth the pistachio and the pistachio almond croissants are filled with pistachio cremepaste deliciousnnthere is a lafleur nearby in case anyone wants poutine before or after,3
the opening time is definitely a plus we wondered by at 900pm and met a full house tastewise its just as it i cant tell too much difference from other similar stores,3
thanks veronica you were wonderful love my new look,4
what an awesome sports bar not to crazy but so fun  finally a great place in the neighborhood looking forward to going back for football season,4
a place that has potential  great burgers happy hour specials and atmosphere but the service lacks  the service is so bad that alone will prevent me from coming back,0
the worst foot massage experienced  my wife agreed  the two girls chatted in chinese non stop while we were there  they basically touched our feet for an hour even after we asked them to do something different  we left the place frustrated as hell,0
the grub experience was better before the takeovermakeoverbut it is a very nice place to snag a drink at the little bar  id go back for a bar lunch by myself,2
might be the fanciest car wash i have ever been to neveryone was super friendly they did a great job cleaning my car and they were quick nwould totally recommend this place to anyone,4
best in phoenix no doubt family friendly to the maximum and the food is incredible a little pricey but we are talking great service with friendly staff relaxing environment with amazing selection did not see a gluten free bun for that special request but all in excellent,4
very good and authentic,4
best scwerma sandwich yet in phx areanand friendly ownernrelaxed cozy homemadendefinitely will be back,3

good sports bar lacking in beer selection but all in all cheap greasy food to soak up the booze and if u got a itchy finger to win the got the vlts too,3
i love good burgers and this place didnt meet my expectations what so ever was not even as spicy as i would have liked if i return ill try the jalapeno burger for sure,1
this is not the best brunch in charlotte its a small chain located in a shopping plaza full of families with their 2 strollers and screaming children the food was decent but im sad i made a drive this way for brunch,1
i came back to try the red velvet waffle and chose grits as my side the cream cheese drizzle is definitely what harmonizes the dish if you havent had the chance free up some time and give this place a try love terrace cafennsee delicious photo now,4
always have had good experience here but not tonight dinner with group of friends had abysmal service first waiter forgot our table and second waitress had a poor attitude when asked about very late food food was ok but definitely not as good as in the past,1
twice in the last 4 trips to jjs we got home and the sub didnt have the toppings we asked for second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault they told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one no thanks wont ever be driving back there,1
deliciosonnkind of expensive for a popsicle but its really good and they have rent to paynndefinitely worth the splurge,4

i had the lunch special minipizza while traveling through tempe  it was too salty  not pleasant  the ambiance was very noisy  the service was slow  i would not go back,1
this used to be my goto for hot wings but lately ive noticed their bigones are much smaller and their hot sauce isnt as hot anymore  i still go there for the convenience and the friendliness of the staff and most importantly the manager but the cravings i have for their wings is slowly diminishing,2
coach christa and suzie are awesome with the novice girls they are great at keeping the kids attention and helping them progress they have helped her in her confidence and patience,4
the food was not good  the owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers i ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless   the homemade gnocchi was brutal  i think they may have frozen it and recooked it  i am not sure how they are still open,0
15 hours late then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule,0
we went here in december in hopes of finding a decent steak house in maricopa  the steak was delicious and cooked to perfection,4

susan started out great and helped with my green pool problem  then she stopped coming and did not return my calls or texts  i paid susan for a month and possibly a month and a half for which i got no service  when i asked for my money back i did not get a reply,0
i like to call this place corner inconsistent the food always tastes great but it is often not quite what you ordered and rarely the same from visit to visit,3
disgustingly overpriced mediocre quality lobster rolls  maybe lukes lobster has spoiled me in ny but this place just offended mennif you hate your money  eat herennsecond star because at least the lobster tasted fresh,1
xl lobster roll 23 bucks it didnt taste fresh  frozen and had to much mayo nnalthough i really did like the hot dog roll that was drenched in butter and toasted to perfection,1
the lobster mac and cheese was terrible i also tried the lobster ice cream which was another terrible idea wont come back for anything else located inside the planet hollywood,1
good spicy thai food buffet,3
they were just featured today on channel 5s dirty dining six major violations what a bummer i really like this place but 6 major violations,0
i used to live in thailand and this is one of my top choices when im on this side of the ocean friendly people and the most authentic thai food ive found in phoenix,4

the same quality pizza grimaldis is famous for in brooklyn   this is the friendliest pizza restaurant you will ever find  the thin crispy crust is something grimaldis is famous for  it is worth the trip round the world  las vegas is really the restaurant capital of the world,4
i just dont get it  the pizza is nothing better than average  anyone from ny will tell you it takes much more than a thin crust to make an ny pizza  the service was very good and the caesar salad was fantastic  my quest for good pizza in las vegas continues,1
we had dinner here again tonight cant say enough about the quality of the food  dining room is clean and new  had the generals chicken med spice and was great  also had the sweet and sour chicken which was not overly sweet like most place ive had,4
the first time couple of times i went there they were closer to four stars but this last trip put them at a three star the combo kung pao was just average i really hate meat that is mushy and thats what the beef was this is just your average chinese joint with a nice decor,2
tried to make delivery over the phone girl could not understand me when giving my address i would give numbers she would rearrange the numbers get my apartment number confused with my street number gave up and hung up,0
pretty good had the curry chicken was pretty enjoyable but fried rice wasnt to die for i got delivery and it was super quick no complaints this time,2
the worst apartment complex tied because of the management and the people here are sketchy and now there are gangs but across the street from panda express and down the street from the wealthiest place in henderson but the worst cops in the nation because they are sketchy to,0
banh mi dog looked great but taste was lacking the dog itself was rubbery and bland while the topping of lightly pickled veggies was pretty good,2
great hot dogs i had the chicago dog and my wife had the chili cheese dog both were great the fries were also good the employees were friendly and the service was fast the place was clean and in good order as well give it a try,4
i havent had a bad hit dog yet everything ive tried has been delicious service is fast and the fries are the bomb,3
ate a chicken corn dog  fries from here yesterday ive been sick ever since vomiting diarrhea chills feverdefinitely food poisoning of some kind if you decide to go here make sure everything is cooked all the way through,0
i had the angry dog and it was very very tasty i will definitely be back to this place they have unique flavors its not your normal hot dog stand thats for sure,4
we come here every couple weeks when we want solid hotdogs or bowls the staff is super friendly and the food is amazing try the euro fries for a delicious twist,4
miss my old home best place to live gated community security and close to everything the 101 202  60 tempe marketplace mesa riverview and 10 minutes from old town scottsdale,4
very loud for my taste on a monday night but the man working the bar was beyond attentive i tasted the wellbalanced reuben and some gooey fluffy delightful battered cheese curds,3
so please tell me why this restaurant stops selling food before 10pm when they are open until 2am,0
good food reasonable prices and friendly staff would recommend it if youre nearby,3
had a nice breakfast i tried the mexican omelette and it was very good i recommend getting the salsa on the side as my omelette had a lot of salsa on it they had fresh squeezed lemonade which was really good as well if you need to get some breakfast this place was great since its in a nice location,3
good portions service ok food quality questionable still a new location so maybe theyll get better  sort of expensive,2
for the money and the availability this is an excellent place  excellent value clean quiet and comfortable,3
way over priced 23 for two salads and two sodas really  i will drive to stephanie next time,0
they are amazing and i love visiting this location my house was decorated beautifully for christmas because of their service and helpfulness despite az painting companies horrific paint job on our home at least we had pretty decorations that would distract from the amateur job that was done,4
wandered in while after red ribbon this shop is so cool everything that caught my eye was under 30 so its a perfect place to run for a last minute party dress good selection friendly staff they gave me a discount card on the way out i will definitely be coming back,4
sensational nnbruntsfield does it again la barantine serves up absolutely sensational sandwiches and their pastries sublime i had a pistachio macaroon and was blown away by its tastennonly very small inside so if walking past and you see a free table inside grab it,4
veggie sandwich is delicious love the sweet potato fries  i cannot complain about a sports bar that carries la crema pinot noir just for me,3
rainbow donuts has really good fresh donuts the staff is very friendly i usually will pick some up for an event they have a good variety the earlier you come the better section they have i highly recommend these local donuts as the national donut chains dont even compare to these,4
went in for a stereo and speakers i was attended right away and it was installed in about 1 hr for a fair price,4
i had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items the food was very disappointing foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops i ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry the only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service,1
not a bad spotcool vibebut a little overpriced  they were nice enough to replace our octopus dish which i thought was a little rubbery  for vegas they are prob better spots to visit since this is in a weird location  prob wouldnt return,2
good food and a surprisingly intimate venue at the quiet end of the strip well worth giving a try kind of a little gem i had the duck which was okay the breast could have been more tender but the presentation was good and the taste was balanced,4
this place is a gem the food is awesome,4
our grocery store of choice in the area,4
we had the meatlover and pesto chicken pizzas delivered  maybe its better fresh from the restaurant but i didnt think it was anything amazing  still toasty warm when we got it fast delivery and i did like how thin the crust was but the pizza itself was mediocre,1
a cool coffee shop with beer what could be better well how about serving beer past 1000 on a saturday  totally stupid operating hours for the bar reminds me of of more like a dorm room than a place to go hang out in,1
im always in search of great coffee and this place has great coffee its a little place and if you blink you might just miss it the staff was knowledgable on their coffee and equipment  it reminds me of the type of place you would find in downtown phoenix but instead its in scottsdale,4
consistently ok food i adore the fish tacos other meals ive had there are literally not memorable it is a small clean little place the service ive had here has been pretty good on most occasions but can be a little slow,2
found a great dress but when i was trying it on the fitting room attendant opened the door on me without knocking and i had to slam it shut mind you it was the same attendant who let me in that room less than 5 minutes before no apology nothing they definitely need customer service training here,1
clean small just make sure your make an appointment otherwise you will be waiting for a long time however if you happen to wait for awhile they automatically give you a free tanning session,2
china star had gone out of business closed,0
justus is the man when it comes to hair hes a genius at color too theres definitely a reason why i followed him from the good old palms place days when we worked together stop by and let him work his magic on you,4
beautiful new thai restaurant great atmosphere excellent service and absolutely delicious food  the 2 course lunch special is a great deal  i will definitely put gaati on my short list of favorite restaurants  plus the owners rock,4
what i love about this place is that the service is constantly fabulous the food is wonderful and the company divine love everything about it is specially the too young lady sitting next to us,4
great food until 2 am really healthy and other options in vegas basically when you want them is pretty impressive everything i tried was great salads juices wraps and this is my second trip back worth a regular trip even when im in town as a tourist for latenight munchies,4
we waited for more than an hour and a half to get our food it wasnt even that good it was normal but the smoothies were better very healthy and made with real fruits,0
left them a voicemail almost a week ago and never received a call back,0
i had the lobster burger yes i said lobster burger it was phenomenal omg i have never had anything like it the best thing i have ever put in my mouthnthe service was impeccable this place rocks open 247 too,4
in ceasars palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance so we ended up here i ended up getting the chilli cheese fries 8 not well spent small amount and the same quality as weinerschnitzel no jokennwill most likely pass this up next time i should have spent my 8 on a slot machine,1
in shortit was fantastic i have access to many celebrity chef restaurants on the strip  embers rates as high as any of them just delicious comfort foodand we left knowing there were many other menu items we would have orderednna great locals spot and very affordable,4
very delicious i had great customer service as the staff is very attentive and they have a great brunch and dinner selection if in the summerin area i definitely recommend trying them out,3
i like this place so much  its fun the food was tasty and the monstrous decor most certainly appeals to my halloweenloving nature  i love that they carry a large variety of local beers  we were only there for lunch so id like to see how it lights up at night  they have a dogfriendly back patio too,3
monsterland is a unique and fun place to enjoy drinks food and a great atmosphere  the food is good and the staff are very friendly and helpful  the decor is a dream come true for all the monster lovers in az  thank you monsterland for bringing a new and exciting desination to arizona,4
im really sad this place is closed it was a great place to hang out with friends their themed event nights were always a blast and the decor was unlike anything else in the valley the employees that worked there were like family and the food was tasty,4
no,0
had them before they revamped their menu had them after both were disappointing can make my own ramen meal from packet ramens,1
honestly dont know why everyone loves this place the yelpers below me must be drunk when they went here food sucks prices are too high for quality of service and the people cooking the food look like convicts recently released from tent city,0
love fuzzys  i always get the chicken nachos w feta garlic sauce white queso and its super yummy  prices are reasonable and they now deliver  great place for take out eat in drinks etc  go for taco tuesdays as well,3
surprisingly good pizza,4
i specified no sauce on stir fry vegetables they were sopping  i specified with a call back after order extra hot mustard no mustard in delivery the soggy vegetables were swimming in the plastic take out bag i called the owner he couldnt have cared less hate this place,0
the service stunk other than the woman bartender three of the guys looked at me about 5 times and didnt take my order this is a collegeyoung crowd bar so i probably didnt belong there anyway so live and learn when your visiting from out of town,1
always end my nights out here great games cheap drinks and fun people watching if i could change one thing it would be the bathroom adding a sliver of a stall to make 2 whole toilets shouldnt have eliminated porta potties we are speed drinking here we need toilets,3
shared the sautu00e9ed mushroom and hummus appetizer not bad different concept cute presentation but the service so slow a cool place to chill at and have a beer though,2
amazing little place  so many sodas and root beers  love it must go and eat waffle sandwich mmmmm,3
the food quality has worsened a lot in recent months must be a new chef almost every dish has less taste and less meat too bad,1
patrick hassett is one great person to work with he is always available to answer my questions and he saved me a ton of money over my previous insurance company do yourself a favor and have patrick give you a quote,4
excellent customer service professional friendly and very clean environment nicole was amazing i will be happy to go back,4
love itni have been here twice and cant recommend it highly enoughnso much fun,4
i went in one day for a orange julius and the machine was not working a week later stopped in with some coworkers and chocolate cone wasnt available a number of workers but awkward ordering and delivery system i could not identify a supervisormanager on duty during either visit,1
went in for a quick lunch time mani the lady didnt speak much but was polite and friendly overall she did a good job but i was very dispointed that i was charged 2000 for a basic manicure,2
food was actually pretty darn good  the turn off was the whole time we were trying to eat  they were walking around killing flies not the most appetizing thing in the world,2
if you want to have the best breakfast in town you have got try this place small town feel wonderful service,4
mediocre quality food tasted fine but was lukewarm the fries were cold and i recieved half a cup of fries not a good experience at all for over 20 will not eat here again,0
had a little bit of most of the food everything we had was good at a good price service was good too with the variety  of items no way your not going to get your moneys worth,3
im never going back crooks no customer service and i spent three days there for the same issue an issue i found after they said everything was good 10 min from getting the job done they closed the doors after the 3 days of me waiting and wanted me to come back well im not im going somewhere else,0
good new thai place in mesa compared to thai patio the portions are huge and just as good and they usually get the spicy level just right for both me 35 on a 15 scale and my girlfriend 2 on the curry they have a fried shrimp appetizer thats also pretty good  definitely my favorite thai in the area,3
the most amazing bakery the tarts are to die for ive tried almost everything there and they are all equally just as amazing  the lemon cake is my favorite  this lady sure knows how to bake and the service is wonderful,4
not a huge fan  while the staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean  my wife and i didnt like the areas very much  dry sums it up  the best part of the meal was the empanadas 1 but quite small and the platanos check it out maybe your experience will be better,2
oh my god amazing falafel tasty pita what more can you ask for i was so ridiculously full after stuffing my face with this portable awesomeness aka the banzo pita sandwich but boy was i happy no regrets,4
typical bartype food good beers on draft lots of tvsgood place to watch a game  i highly recommend the buffalo chicken sandwich or the blackened tuna sandwich,2
hungover on sunday and your man is dragging you out to watching football i pretend to hate going to watch football but 4 bloody marys on sunday i will hoot and holler alllll day they are delish and the bartender taught me a drinking game to give me a reason to want to watch the game,4
the teppanyaki steak  shrimp was very good and our chef was a lot of fun but i really did not like the sushi i actually thought it was my least favorite sushi in vegas the service was good the staff attentive and friendly but i would not go here for sushi ever again,2
this place has a nice selection of draft beers the pizza crust is very good and the homemade pastas are quite tasty,2
excellent service a very good food a expensive,4
best steak ive had out in phoenix i ordered the new york and thought it was more flavorful than the fillet loved the modern atmosphere  i will definitely return,4
sat down to a dirty table and waited 15 minutes for service one of us spilled a water and the waitress asked us to leave she was extremely rude and unprofessional if you want to eat at a dirty restaurant with terrible service this is the place for you,0
the beer is average but overpriced  save yourself 10 on a case and wait until costco restocks  30 a case at the brewery 20 at costco   perhaps i would return if they end up opening up an actual restaurant  as the staff there were extremely friendly but not too much of a draw at this point,2
how can you go wrong with pita i mean are their things i dont like on the menu sure the point is more times than not i have left tummy full  happy service is good place is always lively and they have great kid plates go its good,4
pita jungle is pita jungle is pita jungle theyre all the same no matter which one you go to they all have the awkward hipster  staff members and the food is the same at each one beyond that the food is always good and i appreciate theyre being a healthy alternative on this side of town,3
ehhhh the food was expensive and not very good i hoped for better and have had better,1
bad bad bad need i honestly say more bad service and bad wings what else would i go for wings taste like the kroger brand hot sauce do yourself a favor and go to native new yorker,0
stylish place with a nice patio when open food is decent enough but really the place to come if you like tequila four hundred types of tequila on stock,3
this places bagels are just incredible  they are fresh chewy and made onsite  i had the sexy which was awesome  the owner rang me up and was incredibly friendly  if you love authentic fresh bagels this is your place,3

great food service and vegan options love this place,4
becky and tia were amazing they were on time polite professional and attentive from beginning to end the massage treatment my wife and i received was just what we needed and a fantastic ending to an already great valentines day,4

jessica recommended an item on the menu and my new favorite is the chipotle chicken wrap any chickenhealthy eater spicy lover this is what you want,4
bad local produce try spoiled produce appalled by the lack of freshness vegetables were past their prime we left hungry so disapointed we wanted to support a local business but this was so bad all the good reviews are lies,0

absolutely disgusting  would never go back food terrible service rude cant imagine there are enough tourists to keep this place open for much longer  stay far far away,0
great schtick as a previous reviewer wrote i dont remember much about the food frankly i seem to remember enjoying the onion rings so it probably wasnt fantastic but the experience of eating made the visit worth it,3
just ok,1
great service great food priced a little high and the coffee is horrible they need a light breakfast blend instead of the sludge,2
not fresh and overpriced service lacking,0

best experience in scottsdale  my friends and i had a blast nngreat for a work get together bachelorette or any occasions,4
for a sushi place and their hot dogs r better than their sushi sushi r small poorly made and cost too much  i ordered the tijuana roll  they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out large chunks of white unchewable pieces,1
i walked half an hour to get to this place and it was closed  early december during normal business hours  no explanation or note on door  nni didnt want to skew the ratings so i gave it 3 stars based on other reviewsnnmske sure you call ahead before you go,2
after entering i signed in and then waited ten minutes and still no one acknowledged me  so i went to front desk and said i was new to this service she told me to fill out paperwork  all the ladies behind the front desk were very busy chatting  where is customer service these days,0
i didnt have an option but to choose at least one star this is the most horrible food i have ever tasted,0

i was not a fan of the psychedelic ng strings the neon electric pants  the store doesnt nhave nothing nice  unless you want to wear a tutu and some crazy ass pants,0
they are moving to ground at the old cheuvronts september 23,4
good deal on color printing here they charge by the amount of coverage on the page so color prints can be less expensive if there is a lot of white space in your document  quick turnaround and personal service definitely worth using and a local small business as well,4
great beer selection and pretty good wings last time we got two large orders to go they were over charred and tasted like they had been cooked on a dirty grill pretty yucky usually they have decent wings though,2
great atmosphere awesome bartenders when they feel like it occasionally good electronic club dance music nnplease note apparently no ski hats are allowed insidefailnsmoking is permitted so do it up,3
three and a half stars rounded up slickables is simple choose your cookie and your ice cream pay eat its cheap and delicious with freshly baked cookies and dreyers ice cream i just wish the interior was more put together it isnt very inviting or well decorated,3
ice cream between fresh baked cookies is just as delicious as it sounds super delicious,4
great ice cream great prices  quaint little ice cream shop our family of six each had a yummy dessert for under 20,4
food took forevernpeople working there just seemed annoyed that people were there waitress making annoyed sounds and gestures to people behind their back no good,0

conveniently right near my house and next to my gym the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable clean beds be sure to check out groupon because they have specials deals there too,4
food took way too long,0
amazing amount of tvs for the size of the place really large selection of beers in bottle  on tap though the best options are in the bottle  hope they revisit their tap selection soon burger was good i preferred it to the ones ive had at burger rehab great place to watch a games,2
i did not like the food i see a lot of oil in curries i dont recommend this to anyone,0
only mediocre compared to texas de brazil it fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar slightly short on the meats couldnt believe we were seated with no reservation so easilynow i know service was overzealous i guess thats better than inattentive,2
excellent customer service wonderful and consistent food every time we come here definitely the best brazilian style steakhouse in las vegas,4
this night is super busy enough meat togo around though,3
good service good food,3
super bombnfeels like the one in calinreally love the shrimp  whole shebang flavor,4
not a huge fan it was okay at best ive been to a few of these types of places around town and this one was average,2
david woolen always does a fantastic job  friendly courteous and careful around areas where pets and kids play i appreciate bulwark exterminatings always fantastic customer service,4
tacos were ok,2
went there for lunch and the food was fantastic there is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking their ice tea is a blackpassionfruit blend that was very refreshing very trendy decor and i would definitely go back,4
ambiance yes sushi not so greatneel was fishy tasting not very fresh same with big eye tunana few other sushi places in area offer fresher fish but with less ambiance,1
wonderful  the food service  atmosphere are great  miso carbonara is so good without the richness  deserts are excellent we had the tiaramisou  next time we try the creme brulee  the staff is gracious and friendly  we will be back,3
its ok it needs more fresh produce somewhere in the market there are nice vendors there but it needs more market types,2
cool concept slight miss on execution half the booths are closed on sunday no designated parking just for the market we got turned away across the street by the church organization parking garage closest to it charges 2 per 20 minutes,2
omg great burgers i fell onto this place after shopping in the mall area  i ordered the phoenix and my daughter the portabello mushroom both were delicious although i favored mine with the jalapenos didnt care for the skinny fries with sea salt as they had very little flavor and were dried out,3
smashburger was so kind and provided us with a voucher to return weve been going regularly without any additional problems thank you smashburger,4
i love how youre able to order drinks get cheap tickets on groupon and eat food while watching your movie the seats are super comfortable and they can turn into love seats if youre there with your significant other love this theater and try to go see as much movies as possible there,4
food is mediocre but the popcorn is awful this is the only theatre that serves extremely salty popcorn how do they manage to ruin popcorn servers are a mixed bag few are good others are sleepy dont go here for the food,1
a nice change of pace from the cookiecutter breakfast places decent food at a decent price with a friendly staff if your looking for a nice small business to spend your breakfast or lunch money on then this is it,3
norms has become my go to breakfast joint in summerlin the food is good service is good good is ample and wifi is free and fast nnthe breadtoast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when i order eggs the wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu,4
great beer selection but way way way too expensive 15 for two beers save your money and go elsewhere,0
pizza was delivered in a timely fashion but it was burned and almost inedible the cheese bread was even just average i will not be ordering here again,0
i ordered a latte and for the first time i felt i drank the worst ever coffee in my one and half years in the us the caribous and starbucks were closed and this was my only option i threw the coffee into the trash even before its half done it sucks big time,0
blink and you may miss the parking lot entrance this qt is conveniently located but finding the entrance to the parking lot is easily missed if you dont enter from the  neighboring businesss lot,3
15 minutes for two lattes  the staff finished 3 orders that were behind me before realizing i was waiting for something youre very lucky that theres not a starbucks in verrado,0
really great concept food is good and the coffee is super tasty my little one loved it we will definitely be back nice job,4
love this place the service was great everyone was super friendly the atmosphere was just incredible,4
beer was okay couldnt find anything on the menu that wasnt fried or full of bread  my friend ordered a pizza and it came out wrong three times,1
ok ohso i love you but seriously you charge a dollar to sample a beer just one beer thats kinda ridiculous,1
ive only had the pad thai so far but it was excellent they apparently have a thai chef so most the dishes have a southeast asian flairwhich i lovennive heard that the korean burritos are also excellentfresh ingredients tasty saucennthe owner is wonderful and very eager to please the customers,4
not surprised that theyve gone under bad service and no lunch menu  who wants a huge 2530 dinner entree at 12 pm,1
from the moment we entered the building we knew it was a mistake  the staff was a bunch of kids that didnt appear to be the least bit concerned with offering genuine customer service the menu was extremely limited and the food was marginal,0
great brunch for 20 food is fresh taste good and good service,3
the place is nice but it would be great if they would be consistent every time you go the food is different,1
you get what you pay for then a little more here i just  hate that they advertise hot and ready pizza but i order and its 6 min for them to make it how is that hot and ready,1
absolute ripoff  i took 3 shirts in and they charged me 1947  ill never go back  thats what i get for not checking yelp first,0
by far the most authentic delicious and friendly pizzeria ive been to i cant wait to visit again,4
awesome tasting pizza,4
this place had some damn amazing pizza some of the best pizza ive had in vegas and pizza is all i eat when im out there,4
the vegas meets italy pizza is one of the best tasting pizzas in the neighborhood also the guys there really care about the food they sell and will gladly elaborate on any questions you might have go eat and be merry,4
hit  miss   today was a miss eggs and bacon both under cooked pecan pie was runny and glopy,1
tho pho here is great broth tastes almost good as pho so 1 nthe restaurant is very empty around 4pm maybe that is the only reason they have times to keep the place very clean all the time lol  nngood place,3
music was awesome drinks were overpriced enough that i gave this place a two maybe thats par for scottsdale but i dont think 18 dollars for a captain and coke and a double red stag and coke is acceptable,1
had to go in when i saw the sign didnt expect to buy anything but i found a cool zombie hello kitty shirt for my daughter its a little too big but maybe after it gets washed a couple of times she can wear it to kindergarten,3
real neat idea  neat to visit  some useful stuff  a bit overpriced  staff very helpful,2
the lady that answers the phone is rude and btw they no longer accept spayneuter pet vouchers,0
great place to get that hard to find spice type of stuff,3
good service shop for basic things like a smog or quick oil change prices decent about 16 for a smog and 28 for an oil change,3
this hotel was just terrible the room they checked us into had fixtures falling off the wall no phone and no working light when we complained they put us in a room not much better would rather camp in the parking lot,0
had a water heater go out the rocky mountain restoration team got my home looking back to normal in no time very grateful for their help,4
old town whiskey is closed,2
the smoked wings are amazing we also got the pepperoni pizza and the house salad and both were good on sundays they have 2 bloody marys which makes for a great night of football,4
got a flyer in the mail thinking yeah another waste of moneywell i was wrong fast delivery great food pizza ribs and brisket was all super yummy thanks to great new businesses definitely i will be back for more yummy food,4
yum if you need a quick pizza come here or better yet have them deliver i love the thin crust pizza will never get papa johns again when we order in the pizza is always hot flavorful and fresh plus you cant beat the price and they mail out coupons too,3
having traveled to peru numerous times i must say that the food here is equal to or better that what is available in peru we went there for lunch and went back to have dinner the owners and wait staff work very hard so that your dinning experience is well worth a visit enjoy,3
chef ben is a great little place to enjoy some awesome sushi and food at a very reasonable price a good amount of rolls average 350 and are very well prepared this place was so good we went back the next day,4
my breakfast and my boyfriends was very bland we got the waffles and the blueberry lemon pancakes the pancakes didnt even slightly taste like lemon and the waffles were mediocre although the presentation was nice i wont be coming back,1
when i purchased a used dell from foxetech alex was great to work with  i give me several options and was able to find something that was able to work with my budget  he as also been very helpful with repairs and upgrades,4
the music is wayyyyy too loud very nice staff but i felt like i couldnt have a conversation because the music was turned up so much,2
stop trying to roll my burrito into the size of a baseball it doesnt make it any bigger  for 195 dallop of guacamole make sure the avocados are at least ripe  guac from unripe avocados is not ok no matter how much you puree it,2
staff was dressed in 20s gear cute touch still very pricey drinks but a very cool and mellow atmosphere good place to sit and talk  saturday night they had a dj spinning live,1
the food was all top notch one of the best steaks i have ever had the stories of old vegas were great from the show girls that work there,4
well my favorite breakfast place just joined the mundane  the quality and service still remain but my favorite part of eating there the weekend menu of surprise breakfast dishes is dead the new menu is just like other breakfast places  please bring back the weekend imagination,3
the barbecue here is amazing im from texas too  a few must tries on the sides are the mac and cheese corn succotash greens and grit fries dont forget to try the bread pudding staff was extremely friendly i will make sure to make this place one of my pit stops on all my vegas trips,4
went in for breakfast burritos after a big night out aside from my burrito leaking some sort of sauce on my pants it was fine nothing great but not bad did the trick and under 10,2
great place to relax and getaway from the vegas strip lots of competition near by but i was completely satisfied,3
food is good and service was good food is more expensive than ihopnme and my wife returned several weeks later and she finds hair in her food we will not return,0
every time we come the service is prompt and courteous  we had nicole e again as our server and she is phenomenal  super nice and checks on you just enough,4
this place is always busy but one can get seated pretty fast the food is always heat however the service was surprisingly bad what i order is none of the servers business if i want to order something big then take most of it home that is my business not hers to comment on,3
this place has mediocre drinks  food ive tried a few food items boba  fruit shaved ice not sure if the drinks are fresh because i always leave with that syruplike taste the last visit i had the place unfortunately stunk thanks for good service  being open late though,1

reading some of the other reviews i feel like i must have eaten at a different restaurant i order two spicy tuna rolls with brown rice both had zero flavor and could have been molded from elmers paste instead of fish nnmaybe i ordered the wrong thing seems like a good concept,1
please keep this place alive quick easy delicious  its the american way,3

we had to try it after golf food was ok scenery was very nice and extremely young why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive,2
the menu is very small and very greasy not good beer selection i understand its a hootersesque type of establishment so i wont knock it for that the decor is appropriate for its name i probably wont go back not a place for a foodie like myself,1

a family member brought a sandwich from here and found a pubic hair in it when she took it back and told them they laughed at her if i could shut this place down i would disgusting immature staff,0
ate breakfast with friends  the french toast was overwhelming  more than any one person should eat  the bacon is the best in town  compares favorably with ihop across the street and would pick indy over a chain anytimennwill go again if just to try the bacon doughnuts,2
this is one of our favorite places to go  good food love the omelets and of course the bacon  good coffee  service can depend on whos area you are seated in but over all we havent had a bad experience  make sure if you go at lunch that you order before any big groups it can take a while,3
heaven im in heaven bacon,3

horrible service sloppy install and late for appt more than once  they had to come out multiple times before finally i gave up  to top it off they damaged my car and didnt tell me  stay away,0
not authentic mexican food as advertise disappointednburn beef hard to bite commercial flour tortilla nothing to be excited about maybe the only mexican is the owner sad,1
they were off their game took 40 minutes to get our food  tables were dirty customers were unhappy food was soso  just lots of little things that really built up and made for an unpleasent visit will be hard to return anytime soon,1
menu was confusing probably will try the other ramen spot next just to compare spicy options are limited gyozas werent that good ramen was mediocre at best,2
decent thickness and nice roast of chashu spicy misco doesnt go over the good taste of soup but i would still prefer the original i will not order gyoza next time because i am  going to save space for the ramen,3
after living in japan for 4 years im very particular about the kind of ramen i eat however ramen sora blew my taste buds the corn butter ramen with miso broth was decadent rich and literally melted in my mouth i get it everytime i come here its average price about 810 a bowl but it is so worth it,4
i dont understand why people would like this place this place is horrible the broth gosh it was disgusting it has that weird smell and that roast pork gosh is that roast pork do they know what roast pork is now it makes me feel like yelp is unauthentic,0
honestly wasnt the best ramen ive tried in vegas the gyozas pot stickers werent as crispy and the broth was a little too oily for me this is coming from a native japanese girl so yeah,1
been here probably a dozen times and it never disappoints  besides the ramen the gyoza and the fried rice are great too,4
pretty good ramen if not a bit pricey but still wayyyyyyyy cheaper than the strip  not too oily and the broth and meat were perfect  i had the delux shio though i was a bit bummed by the size of a standard  i think next time ill get a non deluxe option and bump it up to a large for just a buck more,3
this place continues to amaze me the screaming is awesomewhat is really great is the leftovers after a couple dayseven betterthe flavors are unlike any others anywhere fabulous,4
the place is jam packed with stuff i do not need but fun to look over,2
love this placealways new things to see can spend hours herealways bring just a little bit of cash or else ill spend alot of money here,4
excellent small and quiet friendly staff and amazing food the rice is especially delicious the salsa has a kick and hit of lime devine the chile relleno was delicious and presented beautifully the chicken fajitas were marinated and moist and juicynncheck out the womens bathroom for a laugh,4
jets is delicious you will not find any pizza place in town that gives better pizza than jets as a frequent goer i recommend the 8 corner pepperoni with cheese on the crust also the barbecue chicken will not disappoint,3

my wife  i went this buffet restaurant for lunch recently in our opinion we sampled many dishes including the mongolian barbecue  also the sushi  all dishes are average  the waitress was friendly,2
very bad service  their payment method is very strict  they charge about double what you would pay in chinatown  they arent interested in repeat customers as they are rude,0
incredible customer service scheduled them for an airport pickup before thanksgiving they called to let me know driver was delayed and to keep me ontime reimbursed me for my fare in another cab,4
delicious food  if you are opting out of wine try the cucumber honey lemonade  it is so crisp and refreshing  you cannot go wrong with the bruschettamy favorite is the roasted pepper and goat cheese  i could have done without the toddlers on either side of us but hey when in gilbert,3
yum  the whole meal i kept saying this is the kind of food i love  flavorful fresh and sooooooo yummmy    we shared one appetizer with soft pretzels sausage cheese etc yumm  i had the pick 2  prosciutto and brie and the raspberry chicken salad again yum,4

beware of the cat nazi lady my family and i went there to adopt a cat for our home and she was rude and impolite to us and wouldnt  show us the cat we picked out from the window this lady should be checked out in a psycho ward lol poor cat wouldve have a very nice home,0
its unfortunate that they dont charge a dollar or two the quality if this theater is in par with dollar theaters goodyear needs a quality theater  both dirty and poor quality sound,0

to those of you who have given this place a less than favorable review more than a month ago you owe it to yourself to give it another try  the new management has really stepped up the food service and the happy hour is as good as it gets both eats and drinks  id give it six stars if i could,4
for an airport eatery this is above par hense the 4 stars decent medium well cooked burger with slaw nnwould be a 3 star outside of an airport though,3
i got seated straight away the waitress brought me a glass of wine a soda and water in seconds flat my burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested my empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table decent prices for an airport,3
good burger good waitress just good thing its at the airport not exactly sure would have went out of the way for it if it was in general public area,2
good food bad service they took away our drinks whole table for a refills and it took 5 minutes before they returned i didnt even gave any water  had to walk to front to ask for our check too,2
food is ok not great  ive had way better,2

terrible food food all seems like it was from a box and cooked from frozer but thank goodness there was free popcorn to fill us up possibly the freshest thing in the place,0
great ambiance and good servicenwe tried the ceviche halibut tacos and the chocolate bread pudding everything was excellent,3
typical chain mexicanthe salsa wasnt bad  i had a fish taco and tortilla soup  the fish taco tortilla was americanized as was the filling  the tortilla soup definitely was preprepared,1
food was very tasty the service was excellent but the margaritas were marginal  great atmosphere and people and id definitely recommend,3
not sure if it was because we were all super extremely drunk but the shrimp burritos were bombcom,2

i dont really remember being here but one drink tasted like a jolly rancher and one was like a tootsie roll nnahhhhmazing nnand the britney couture pops so cute,4
i dont understand why this place is multiplying all around the city the food is really poor noodle dishes are mostly noodles and oil rice dishes have the same sauce pad thai has very little but noodles save your money,0
good ribs decent brisket and pulled pork not my favorite chicken  if you want some bbq ribs  come here and get that 5 stars in that department,2
great pulled pork but very pricey,2
im a ksbs bbq judge so im a bbq snob  i really liked the flavor profiles of the food it was all over cooked  macn  cheese was bomb  i think they do better than what i had so ill go back and try again,2
meh it was just ok the food looked better than it tasted   i had the bbq chicken greens and mac  cheese i would give it another try but order other items from the menu nnaside from that the service and atmosphere were great,2
ihop is ihop so the 2 star rating is not for the nation wide chain its for this specific location this ihop has really really bad service food takes a long time to show up drink refiles never come and its not as clean as i would like,1
i have visited with this store many times  what i have been promised in contracts has never happened and if you are not looking for a phone that gives the sales people a big commission be prepared to be ignored,0

the salsa bar is good free chips and salsanthe  people working on the counter are rudenhad the california tacos so plaine has no flavornwont be back,1
pretty ghetto and the music is old but we had a good time because the drinks were cheap had a private space and were partying with good company,2
had the fried chicken it was cooked to perfection hot crisp and juicy the crew was friendly and accommodating all food cooked and prepared to order service was fast and friendly  if they are on your area give them a try you wont be disappointed,4
i ordered the fish and chips the fish was ok the french fries were greasy hand cut fries that were only half way cooked they were so nasty i couldnt eat them the price was 10 total waste of money,0
this placed closed a few months ago,0
the sunset cafu00e9 is quite a find the food is incredible i would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas that is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa this place is a hole in the wall but super clean with a very friendly staff,4
nothing exciting tasteless guacamole would have expected more flavour in a mexican restaurant,1
cute store but so tiny plus they seem so overpriced for what they sell  i enjoy the display but after going in charming charlie its hard to be willing to overpay for similar items and purses etc,1
i am shocked  only one review for ethd  a phoenix institution nnthousands of us do jury duty  eds is a must stop on jury day  especially for the chicago dog  he has all the napkins you need plus places to sit,4
oh my goodness i have a new fav wing place the wings were well cooked and seasoned the sauce didnt drown the flavor of the chicken just enhanced it and their fried catfish sandwich was simply delicious my family loved it and this our new wing spot indeed,4
straight up legit wings joint  all they do is wings and they are amazing they arent a chain and have 18 amazing flavors be sure to ask for the chef special  also get the homemade biscuits  you wont be disappointed  they even let you try the wing sauce before ordering,4
great gelato  come try this new small business in old town scottsdale,4
soooo happy we came here im not usually a fan of eating indian food at a restaurant but we came here for fathers day and we not disappointed everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned too if you like indian food you must try this place,3
i prefer costa coffee so much richer than starbucks and i like the fact that they do pay uk tax as opposed to the dodgy starbucks but alas i do not like any of their cakes they have stopped doing everything i like so its a tin of ground coffee to take home and probably starbucks next time,3
get an espresso drink the brewed coffee cafu00e9 filtre is mediocre and a little stale tasting,2
the burgers and fries are good if you have an addiction to grease and salt also they are very expensive when they first open and people got to experience five guys business continues to fall,0
i have only had their saag  palak paneer one time but it has never tasted better i try this dish at every indian joint and this is by far the best indian meal i have ever had ni wish i lived closer so i could eat it on a regular basis,4

some of the best tacos ive ever had i just wish they carried pico de gallo or red sauce,3
i hereby declare my love for mini quesadillas and everything else they offer here great food,4

disgusting im still sick to my stomach a day after,0
very busy place  you have make sure you check your plate to see if its clean  i had got 4 dirty plates they still had some food left on them,2
well the price was good but i was expecting more not to many options and i didnt like the food it had no taste to it the waiter took for ever to serve us refills and i really thought the place was amazing but in reality it let me down,0
for the price the food was great,3
here in vegas this is pointless you can go to any buffet in town and get way better food and service its so chaotic most of the food taste old the carpets are dirty and this place is new i hate to see what this place looks like after a year,1
be afraid,0
mediocre steak house pretentious service dont let them seat you upstairs many better choices in vegas,1

good not great had the shrimp cocktail and prime ribeye a 54 steak shouldnt need a 6 sauce to put on or dip in to make the steak taste great my wife had the wagyu skirt steak that had good flavor hit del frisco or ruths for better taste not to mention value,2
i would say this was by far the best meal i have ever had there was not one thing that i could complain about i had the wellington and it was perfect  hands down a perfect dinner,4

this place has good food but horrible customer service they used to be wonderful and it was such a treat when i would drive thirty minutes just to eat here i probably pass 25 sushi places just to get here and it was always worth it but the past couple times it has gone downhill,1
i have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased food was great and service was awesome only reason im giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed ha,2
this place is terrible it dirty the food sucks and the service is terrible do not waste your time or money i came here once before and it had just opened and it was terrible so i came back 35 months later and the food still sucks and now this restaurant is filthy,0

this place is a lot of fun even if you are not a kiss fan play minature golf indoors where the black lights make eveything glow play a variety of arcade games and browse the gift shop fun for the whole family,4

burnt hamburger took it back second one same as the first disgusted i just walked out left it on the table asked for another salt she never came back,0
ice tea is awful  pizza has potential but the toppings were scant  our pizza was to have feta cheesei expected more than the half teaspoon we received would like to see improvements in service,2

we got a inhome free consulting and same day installation the rates are competitive and for the service provided we would recommend choosing jpg  over the other giant companies feels good to know our home is secure,4
this is your typical lebanese place that specializes in shish taouk shwarma among others  it has a good number of tables for eating there with a outdoor patio for the warmer months  service is fast and to the point exactly what you want at a fast food joint  if you go for lunch expect a crowd,3

absolutely outstanding  we shared a whole lot of burger and an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries that are just as ridiculous and ridiculously good as they sound  i have not a single complaint about anything we had  cant wait for a return engagement,4
horrible the burgers are extremely small and not even very tasty i will never go here again ok service but the food was nothing special also over priced for the tiny portions they give you,0

food was absolutely horrible service was mediocre it all tasted like frozen or out of a can  nothing authentic spent about 100 on two adult meals two kids meals one beer and one frozen margarita what a waste of time  money dont bother going even the food court was better,0
a fun place with tasty cocktails and a large variety of locally made whiskeys they cocktails are reasonably priced and unique ill be interested to see what kinds of aged whiskeys they produce in the future i want to come back and take the tour next time,4
the ham and cheese croquettes are delicious  the meatballs were okay  the artichoke appetizer was okay  with so many options to choose from i will go back and try more  but i will have the croquettes again,2

had a convention here and the resort seemed a little dated for vegas  the staff was spot on and our convention went off without a hitch  ni worked a lot so i was not able to enjoy a lot of the hotel besides the dinning options they were both really nice for a hotel,2
very nice and grassy park i wish the seating would get washed down more often or some bleacher type seating was installed but over all very nice people usually pick up after their dogs here,3
two words rose macaronsnnok their other desserts are fabulous as well  just dont get the crepes savory or sweetnnthis place is what any business or person should aspire to be detailed refined beautiful clean amazing,3
wow  that is a huge fountain  of chocolate  but no one can eat it   probably a good thing who knows what it would taste like since it has probably been doing that for years nnyummy pastries and gellato  pricey but youre in the bellagio  nnthe kids had vanilla gellato and we split a napoleon   mmmmm,4
i had the truffle crepe and carrot cake desserts they were phenomenal the storeshop is tiny but a great grab and go treat a must try,4

food was great an fresh service was incredibly slow,2
i was a fan but would not go back to many other places to try,3
not bad decent sushi the duck bim bi bap was good extra half star for having orion at the bar view of the waterfall is cool if youre into that sort of thing,2
its food is over priced and the atmosphere is loud and chaotic even though there is an adult section just consider this mainly a hot spot for kids and immature teenagers,2
this place is hands down the best 3d nail art place in las vegas go to this place for top notch nail service,4
got here at 645a in and out  helps to come in early,3
just had my car serviced they did a great job friendly staff and probably the cleanest auto shop ive seen across the country everyone should check these guys out i know where ill be going for all my car repairs from now on,4

food was pretty good the power company had an outage so during dinner it was about 9095 degrees up there which made dinner pretty miserable the manager said we cant control nevada power creamed spinach was no good lobster   bisque was amazing as was the cream bru00fblu00e9e  the steak just ok,1
best oyster shooters  get the lobster bisquenservice and view were amazingnwaiter went out of his way to retrieve my rewards card  complimentary champagne since we were celebrating two birthdays  we had a great time and a lovely meal,4
love the food not a big fan of the environment the chefownernamesake antonio park is charismatic but he lacks a staff around him to really make the restaurant work excited to see what it can become but not terribly impressed with the dining experience thus far,1
without a doubt the best place in las vegas for a sandwich  huge portions and great service never had an issue with service or quality  great patio on sunny days or stay inside with tables and booths you cant go wrong with this place try the santa barbara,4
they are not nice i asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home  the server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake  did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert no  not even an apology,0
paid 7 for a two second pour on a well gin and tonic bar tender was nice but main focus was his cell phone i dont eat dairy so my only sauce option was bbq for pickle chips no marinara or honey mustard or anything,1
decent place but the overly loud and neurotic redhead managerwaitress lady is nerve rackingnnif you go here to relax with a nice meal and a drink she will kill it her loud voice and constant complaining is like nails on a chalkboard,2
good food fat portions  kool to have chino food a phone call away delivery is quick  ppl are nice ive eaten in and its pretty clean and they seem to enjoy there jobs,4
stumbled across this little place while looking for a quick place for breakfast on our way out of town  unexpectedly they make the best cheesy grits ive had in the north seems like a busy local favorite,4

good food and vibel but stay away from the monkfish,3
i wouldnt recommend going here apart from very poor service the food wasnt really great the only thing good on my plate were the fries the lady who served us forgot a couple of our drink orders and when she finally did bring them to us one of them had something floating in it,0
found a shard of glass the size of a silver dollar in the bottom of my glass  the manager took 350 off of our bill ive never been so shocked by such terrible customer service,0
service was slow and the burger came out on a soggy bun  asked for a fresh bun but took forever so ended up just eating the meat  also the place was super hot  everyone at our table was sweating  maybe they were just having a bad night but i wouldnt go back to this place after this experience,1
possibly the best bacon cheeseburger i have had this decade nice cool blue moon beer on draft to wash it down  restaurant was clean  wait staff effecient and courteous,4
the burger was the best ive ever had had the poblano everything from the pretzel bun to the meat and toppings was top notch unfortunately i waited 35 minutes for my food during a slow period the service was abysmal but i will be back for the burgers if not for the service would have been five stars,3

two other customers in the store five staff people working and it takes forever for me to pay for my items due to a shift change horrible customer service avoid this place i am,0

so the last couple reviews ive done have been kind of negative so ive decided to keep this one positivennthey have a really nice patio that is all,1
1030am  230pm the deli side is open  they have the best sandwiches  i recommend the ham and cheese on pretzel bread or the turkey and avocado  as soon as you step in eugene makes you feel welcome is helpful and genuinely glad to serve you,4
very slow  even without a lot of customers  and very disorganized you cant pay with the starbucks app  they have to take your phone and key in the number by hand,1
just as good as rainbow donuts and it is in goodyear,4
friendly staff clean restrooms standard cafe decornthe menu for this place is very diverse ndont expect world class cuisine from a cafe and you wont be let downnfor what it isits fantastic,3
ce nest pas le meilleur thau00ef u00e0 montru00e9al mais u00e7a du00e9panne tru00e8s bien quand vous u00eates dans louest du vieuxmontru00e9al,2
my favorite place to go for fish tacos  they are delicious  i havent liked the other items ive tried as much but the fish tacos keep me coming back on a regular basis,3

this place has a cute theme but i dont know if the nerds would appreciate star trek and star wars mixed together lots of specialty drinks but they are a bit on the expensive side here 6 for a very mediocre chicken sammich makes me sad coffee is ok but only oldies music is being played,1
so underwhelmed food wasnt terrible i have had worse in the land of bbq but its not great,1
i was very impressed with the attention to detail provided by isaac   he was very helpful also in giving tips to conserve energy in our home   he was very reasonable and his report with the pictures was great   i would definitely use him again and refer to anyone who needs an inspection done,4
this was my second time here the first time i had it the cheeseburger was sooooo good but this time it wasnt so great,2
like chipotle with pizza it was quick good service and overall pizza was pretty solid will definitely return,3

the office canceled appointments on the day of service twice very rude service will not return,0
i think all the hype about this place is for the dreamers  i thought the cashier was inattentive and was way too busy talking to his friends to pay any attention to us the customers the ice cream was alright but nothing to make me come back for more,2
great ice cream and for a cause  only open during business hours  for each different flavor a portion goes to a cause ie to help with someones medical bills or to replace a home that burned down  nnthey have about 20 different flavors and basic toppings no sundaes,3
stooped in during a segway tour of downtown pittsburgh great variety of flavors  friendly staff  very cool concept,4
great ice cream perrys which is especially exciting for me since im from the buffalo area great flavors great service and for a great cause  ill be trying to earn that 11th free ice cream,4
terrible experience the server was so rude brought out the wrong food and gave us a hard time as a result the food was ok not good enough to tolerate the horrible server that is clearly dissatisfied with her life  my biggest regret is going there twice,1
the place is good been here for lunch an dinner good selection of rolls and sushi decent ambiance,3
we have eaten at angelas several times with friends in hopes that it would i prove it hasnt the food is terrible the prices are way too high for a senior community and the service is not so hot either i would stay away lovely location though,0

good burger but on the pricy side for what you get i work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they arent open for lunch pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips,2
joe makes the best friggin burgers hands downnnthe rest of the menu is very inventive and plenty of options that are non burger related brian the head waiter is awesome and a pleasure to see  the beer is always ice cold and the shakes are deliciousnn5 burger mondays are insane,4
i as well am glad i didnt have high expectations  there is hardly anything to the hamburger which were very flat and charred on the edges  the onion rings where slightly better but not the best onion rings that i have every had  how about some more meat to those burgers,0
freddys is a betterthanaverage fastfood restaurant  the service is good friendly helpful and consistent  the steakburgers are good as well as their frozen custard  food comes out in less than six minutes usually   it often gets crowded between 121,3
since my last review devils diner has undergone a change in ownership and a change in cook  preparation of the food is much much better  tasty and at a good price  the atmosphere is far friendlier as well,3
food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional  i would have preferred a larger portion it seems in france you get generous portions but french restaurants in the us not so much it seemed a little pricey for the amount of food,2
tha spot has some really good bbq  the know how to do home cooking  you need to try the corn on the cob macarroni and cheese pulled pork and dont forget the smoked hot wings  everything was great  we will be there again soon,4

awesome salads and burgers  different from any other restaurant in the area  very friendly staff,4
while the staff was friendly my take out order was wrongonly discovered after i was home the fries were hot but so soggy they were almost inedible not what i expected from a business affiliated with eat n park,1

full of studying students and hipsters in their native environment  doughnuts arent bad,2
great spot to eat lunch and dinner sundae roll is amazing the charge for the tea is the only reason they are getting 4 stars,3
good choice if you are starved for sushi  my kids loved the instant gratification   service was very good  we visited on mothers day after a trip from sedona and they had a flower for my wife  nice touch,3
like some others i was skeptical because the base boards that i bought were so cheap in comparison to lowes or even lumber liquidators  but the quality of the baseboards was great for the price and the service was good,4
a 3 day kitchen remodel has turned into an 8 day job all these 5 star reviews must be from people they know  the only good thing i can say is that at least they answer their phones,1
my wife and i and another couple visited this place this past tuesday and it was awesome not only was shooting the machine guns great but the staff was unbelievably nice and accommodating highly recommend visiting and try to shoot down the target return string like i did with the m249 saw,4

good crust and quality toppingsnot bad at all,3

wheres the sauce all you hear about is grimaldis famous suuuace but when the pizza comes there isnt any  not great for kids and its a fricken pizza joint server could care less worth the tripno way go get pizza at the place in the promenade at the quad its far superior,1
terrible place to live maintenance crew is no better than the three stooges management lies about everything  multiple shootings car robberies police harrassments what a nightmare cant wait till my lease is up,0
i just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me the girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site there are plenty of other places to eat if you dont want my business,0
food is average at best  third time here and the peaks are the only attraction  way better than hooters  plenty of tvs to watch the games  great location  dont make a special trip for the food,1
they use dish detergent for soap on the feet extremely rude staff i went in 35 mins before closing time and this is what i getrude attitude n dish detergent it would have been better if i was told to come in at another time rather than the kind of service i got will definitely not visit again,0
restaurant sympa la nourriture est bonne et originale mais lambiance est un peu froide et le service impersonnel,2
upgrading martys  have gone back and while service is still mediocre and somewhat slow the food really is well prepared  and its always fresh seasonal and delicious this would be a five if their service could catch up to the atmosphere and food,2
what a great experience  i have been there 2 or 3 times and had an excellent meal and a great evening every time  exceptionally good staff very knowledgeable welcoming polite and professional  excellent menu  very attractive decor,4
not as fashionable as i had thought it would be,2
having trouble finding a great brunch place with no linesnnthis place is never crowded even at peak weekend brunch times  and everything weve had was delicious  they even make an awesome chicken fried steak  would highly recommend for anyone like us with toddlers in tow who cant stand long waits,4
this show was entertainingbut not as good as the sf show well worth seeing,2
we were going to do a cirque show but couldnt fit it in went to the jersey boys instead wow  that was awesome  great story  great music  i am so glad we ended up at this site instead,4
waited 10 minutes in dt for 3 sandwiches that were cold when i got them the mexican in the window only told me to have a good day when i asked what took 10 minutes for me to get my food 3 other cars that ordered all drove off before i got my food horrible service and long wait times cold food,0
i am a loyal customer and love the place the only reason i didnt give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but its clean so i love it,3
just like many other ritas but this one is kosher which eliminates a few products that are even advertised inside the store  only reason why not 4 or 5 stars is because of the kosher options,2
youve gotta try the cotton candy ice with custard its simply incredible,3
we stopped over while in henderson visiting friends tasty flavors friendly staff would come again if we were in the area and time was not a factor nnthree frozen stars,2
i cant imagine it getting better than this great service and convienence  its always clean and neat here,4
great selection sushi hibachi  will make anything you want,3
great place to get your car or truck washed my car is clean and friendly people i recommend this car wash to all my friends,4
ive been coming here over a year now and they are fabulous they are very clean and even if theirs a line of people the wait is never long always pleasant and polite,4
best cheeseburgers in the east valley   service by there employees is always above and beyond,4
this place is dirty and the staff are more interested in talking amongst themselves and eating than helping customers  one dressing room the second is filled with junk  not for me but you go animal lovers,0
linda would groom both my dogs i enjoyed her service but unfortunately left that place because she no longer works there and the two ladys that took over are horrible groomers and the prices went up,1
best cupcakes ever the strawberry is my favorite but they are all good,4
favorite place to get a beer in madison 2 strong ale is always a winner and the penguin ale is a good standby great atmosphere fun crowd and if you get hungry the frabonis pizzas are as solid as frozen pizzas get oh and whoever does the chalkboard art there has got major skills,4
way to hot inside,2
i guess my palate just doesnt appreciate the coffee these guys serve up for those of you you do like their stuff enjoy,0
wo a great place in the airport both the breakfast panini and the cappuccino were perfect and the service was incredibly helpful and friendly i would definitely repeat the visit,4

i loved the atmosphere and food yummy,3
the crew is amazing some of the nicest people ive ever met,4
food was very good service was subpar the bartender seems to ignored us and was very curt and distracted,2
yeah i was not pleased at all with the food i couldnt eat half of what i got odelay scramble with hash browns  the hash browns were very buttery and the scramble was a mess  no real flavor other than butter and the coffee came with coffee grounds and was very bitter,0
modern burger at the airport great breakfast burgernnthis was a quick grabngo run i really liked the breakfast burger youll pay more than you think you should but no more than other airport food and its way better tasting,3
cold and stale fries got the modern dog which is essentially a chicago style hot dog it wasnt clear whether they had bothered to heat it up or cook the hot dog as it was room temperature terrible terrible food,0
my opinion is that the burger is about like mcdonalds with a better bun i was filed cause the guy in front of me had what looked like a thick burger but he must have had a double cause the patties are thin also my order was incorrect fries were ok and i did not try one of their shakes,1
pretty expensive for a burger that ran out of cheese  ordered the double burger with bacon and no sauce and fries  it came out to 12 around  fries were good they tasted like lawrys salt on them  good thing i saved a can of coke during my first flight so that i didnt have to pay for soda,2
pretty good burger place in an airport got the breakfast burger and it was delicious bacon fried egg and a juicy patty  what could go wrong the price is reasonable but the portion was a bit small,2
this place was ok i know theres a lot of good blurb out there and thats why we visited the service was excellent but the food and drinks were just average and the bathrooms were dirty meh,2
that place is horrible we never get served and we got ignored from servers and bartender they did not bring the  menus and didnt even ask us for drinks  for about 10 mins so we just walked out again thats terrible place to go,0
oh baby you got what i neeeeeed trader joes west elm best buy staples marshalls boutique stores restaurants i wish i lived above in the condos for those of us that need to visit the met the parking is atrocious during peak times,2
no longer serving food  and not a huge selection of smoothiesnnstill nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a vegashot class,2
this is the by far the best place ive ever gone for glasses and ive had glasses since kindergarten the employees are friendly and always willing to go the extra mile ill probably continue to go here for years to come best customer service out there and they always have the most amazing frames,4
ooohh such a cute place that looks fantastic but the staff is as cold and pretentious as the menu,0
never use this companynsimply called for a quote on a simple door repair and was turned down because ownermanager did not think it was worth his timennuse vortex and save yourself the headache,0
it has a good car wash but the place stinks literally,0
had a small rv project done at the shop on time and on budget is this really a vegas paint shop highly recommendednmike,4
ts back  they have moved to the old blockbuster space in quail corners at 8400a park road  by far the best salsaritas location in charlotte  i thought that about the old location as well  ingredients are fresh and the quality is impeccable,4
the falafel pita was ok nothing special the pita chips were soft and soaked with oil i could squeeze out the oil overall it was disappointing pita jungle tastes better and is healthier and costs about the same,1
absolutely delicious i have never had pita chips like these and quite honestlyi am spoiled now  everything we had was wonderful and we made sure to let the guy who runs the place know it  will definitely revisit,4
the tacos are terrible the shells are stale and the lack of filling that is put into the tacos makes them more of just a stale shell taco  customer service is a nightmare,0
always mess up my menudo  always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it they might think this is funny thats okay going to el mirage from now on added picture,0
its like the scottsdale gun club without the expense of ammo a great place to practice for the amateur or olympic champion alike there are lessons for kids and adults air conditioned and safe i could spend my entire summer here love it 5 stars all the way,4
what a refreshing change in matthews great atmosphere great wine selection casual and comfortablennthe owner took quite a bit of time to suggest wines share upcoming events and to ensure we were enjoying ourselves i will be back,4
their food is awesome yummy bagels and donuts and fresh coffee but their service sucks they need to learn to be more friendly  have a little more sense of good customer service,1
they always pass out their flyers at the house so if im lucky i get them before blowing all over the lawn kicker is they dont ever offer delivery in our area,0
shared a small white pie and cheese steak wonions  cheese whiz wmy bf for dinner last night both were deeeelish i would highly recommend to try,3
so amazing i just moved in down the street and those guys pizza is shizznit love the spinach salad  super friendly staff  the have made me a happy pizza filled camper,4
great pies and phillys please come to hendo,4
pizza delivery fella was really nice nordering was super easy i was in a house full of littles that were loud so doing it online was handy nthe pizza was ok ive had better but ive had worseni had the bbq chicken i liked the caramelized onions on it pepperoni pizza was ok,2
towbin infiniti became park place infiniti and the service quality and communications have declined,0
it was pretty good i had the bmocpork chop was good that being saidwaffle was soggy from too much syrup the eggs were welleggs the donut thing was ok all in all it was ok ill go back to try something else oh and the coffee was pretty good,2
price  reasonable rangenservice  prompt and friendly natmosphere  parking kind of hard but has a nice outdoor area  overall neat and hipnfood  flavorful  pretty decent overall,3
quaint atmosphere definitely a spot that you could easily pass up but after reviewing other yelpers im glad that we stopped by the food was fantastic with unique twists to some favorites space is limited inside so get there early otherwise they have a small dining section outside in the courtyard,4
fun for a beginners,3
the food is great but i have problems every time i go to this location  service is very poor i will not be going to this location any longer i leave upset every time,0
yelp deal is a big sham i did a togo of food on a tuesday night and the guy at the counter says the manager wont accept it he agrees after i read him the conditions and fine print from yelp  an item in my order was also missing food is soso there are far better places for indian food around,0
horrible place  they ran out of buffet items at 130  then kept promising that they would come in 10 minutes for the next hour,0
fake chipotle,1
my friend just ordered a sandwich from here and the bottom her bread has mold on it how disgusting it should deserve 0 stars but it wouldnt allow me to this mall is really going down hill into the dumps,0
same great food and great people as the old q probably been here 20 times since the nameownership change and its still great,4
pool is nice but not as ridiculous as the pools at the flamingo mgm or mandalay bay nnchill atmosphere nnyouthful crowd but maybe not the scene some people look for,3
excellent job,3
we had breakfast here each morning even though we were with a convention that provided free breakfastnnthe eggs benedict are to die for  so so good  i dream about them  great service too,3
not as good as persian room yet they have really good meat and great servicennhookah is well packed hookah guys are nice and change out charcoal and maintain regularly lots of optionsnnthey also have live music sometimes drinks are pretty good too,3
great service even let me borrow a phone charger when my phone was about to die came often to check on coals good amount of flavors clean and hookahs were great only could be better if they served alcohol but thats hard to find in hookah lounges out here,4
the challah french toast with fried chicken is amazinguntil you come back ive been there three times already always asking for the same plate because i loved it then i have felt disappointed by how the chicken has shrunk from one time to the next,2
don runs a great coffee shop promotes community togetherness and live music and serves up tasty treats here with delicious hot and cold drinks the open mics are a blast as are the featured bands great for all ages,4
for a restaurant at an airport it wasnt half bad we had the yummy calamari i had a mimosa my friend had wine the staff was friendly and upbeat so i would go there again,2
was expensive even with half off had a lot of beers first two picks were out though bartender seemed rushed to finish with me if youre looking to try hundreds of beer on tap this is the place for you just make sure to bring a lot of money,1
good spot on mill to try a wide variety of beers  the servers are friendly and knowledgeable of the beers which is important in a place like thisnnit is a bit loud but they do have an upstairs area that i would recommend if youre with friends and want to have a conversation,2
super fun great artists and teachers good equipment clean establishment helpful staff and lots of paintings to choose from had a blast will definitely be coming back,3
great pizza get a regular pie well done as close to nyc style as you can get they have great daily specials as well,4
disappointinga long list of beers that they brew and only 3 were checked as available  whatnnnice patio friendly service and the wood fired pizzas looked good too but i couldnt get past the limited types of beer offered,2
my favorite micro brew have been going since they opened and i absolutely love fate,4
came here super late like 3 in the am and needed food bad good customer service they have a great selection i had the pepperoni pizza and it was ok it hit the spot because i had been drinking but dont know how it would have been if i was sober,2
the food and the service was really good best burgers in town the stuff very was friendly,4
cant beat their selection on childrens clothing i was commenting to an employee about the great finds for childrens clothes and toys and she mentioned thats most of their donations when im in town ill make it a point to go there again,3
such a cool place stopped in for lunch and had a wonderful experience even got a free appetizer for checking in split an order of delicious calamari followed by a lobster roll the roll was messy but worth it would definitely return and recommend to friends,3
still sitting in the booth after a great breakfast of chicken fried steak we have deemed this our new breakfast place,4
great food  good service  our office orders sandwiches and were all happy with the food,4
flight delay allowed us to have a wonderful breakfast here at beaudevin sarah is a 5 star waitress  great lox and bagels eggs florentine and greek yogurt surved with exceptional coffee,4
mmmm what can i say about le milsa its really nothing amazing the meat is extremely salty obviouslyso you drink a ton of water and therefore eat less its always very loud and the service is soso the only amazing thing here is the sauteed mushrooms out of this world but not really worth 3540 meh,1
i had the fish and tofu tacos for lunch they use corn tortillas which i respect the fish was good and the tofu mixture was interesting but the tacos were not particularly great  the location seems good though the bar has a lot of space around it and i assume the patio is quite nice,2
went here for drinks for one night they called last call and 5 minutes later they kicked everyone out making my friend chug her beer and meanwhile it wasnt closing time yet very crappy service,0
great patio and service but the food is pretty bad its hard to mess up guacamole and they even managed to do that come for a drink but go somewhere else for dinner,1
the food here is great but the service is always slow no matter what it took almost 15 minutes for soup and a scoop of premade salad and it wasnt busy i have waited over 40 minutes in the past for a sandwich when it was busy,2
enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week friendly knowledgeable staffand good food my salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special  green chili stew,3
awesome food and great service portions run small so be sure to get an appetizer if youre hungry,4
this is a food lovers paradise  it was simply fantastic  you can really tell they have a talented chef that cares about his food and wants to give you the best they can  they deliver on that promise  there is not a better restaurant in this area,4
great service  large portions  a bit tricky to find the place in the dark but its worth it,2
the husband and i have gone to arrowhead tan  nails for the past 6 months to get pedicures the staff is always friendly and they always do an amazing job we would highly recommend them,4
cho nay gio lam nuoc leo khong ngon gi ca va lai mat tien 825 mot to pho va cho lau lac gan het 30 phut moi co do an,0
this place is quite close to the strip nice noodles and great new kinds of spring rolls  i always visit here for my vegas trip especially in the morning after the crazy night,3
walked out went with a group of five for breakfast and the owner said that big groups should go to eatnpark were just a little cafe i suppose our money wasnt good enough if youve got three or more in your group go to hanlons cafe just down the road,0
actually no star called in to inquire if we can order togo because we have to catch a train but the rude patron told us to call mcdnonalds and hung up terrible customer service,0
impromptu stop here for a small bite  did happy hour with two visiting friends from seattle  really enjoyed the place and we were all quite pleased with our food  mussels fish tacos verde stew and fried green tomatoes,3
this place rocks 50cent drafts an 1 bottled of pbr on thursday nights and their chicken is awesome i usually get the half clucker with steak fries that stuffs the bomb,4
this lady is anything but professional she talks like crazy even of her personal life with her assistants i call 24 hr before my appointment to cancel  and she wanted to charge me 100 then i still went to her office and she didnt even do what it was suppose to be done personally i dont recommend her,0
this place is great and affordable every dish i ordered was great we will be back,4
everything is ok prices are reasonable  i think most of dishes are much sweeter than authentic japanese style to me  it is very casual place it might be fun to come here after the long day to have fan,3
big slices but not the most impressive place for pizza worth a try but will not be our regular spot for pizza price doesnt match quality,2
decided to try this place out after we saw a movie at the galaxy theatre we just got one chocolate cake pop for 250 although it was good i thought the 250 was a little much  i can go to showboy bakeshop in anthem and get an entire cupcake for the same amount,2
came here on a holiday june 24th very dissatisfied employees lounging around mumbling waiter dry food i guess the staff here today would rather be home watching fifa hopefully for the owner the food and atmosphere is better on regular days what a waste of time thank god most plates are only 10,0
happy we have another bar in charlotte  but have been there twice now and the wait for a drink does not make sense  when you are paying a bartender 8 an hour and charging 8 dollars a drink do the math  i wish you well bit not sure i will go back  get it together guys,1
i really like this club gay friendly and ppl are 2 ddd,3
the teriyaki bowls here are usually pretty good unfortunately the service is usually pretty bad come here for the food dont come here if you want good customer service,2

i was skepticaly of this idea but my friend wanted to go for her birthdaynnpretty freakn goodnnid go backnot much else to say definitely get custard in your shaved ice thingi dont even know what to call it still i liked the fruity and creaminess,3
i brought my car to clean freak today when i got out the car looked like it was never washed  although i paid for the 500 wash i expected my car to be a least clean when it came out the wash did not even remove a leaf that was on my car i went to the car wash at 59th and bell will never go again,0
my favorite place to get breakfast the staff is awesome food is great and it wont kill the pockets now i need to try something off the lunch and dinner menu,3
it rocked their version of a blt was out if this world from the bread to the avacado oh my a might messy to eat but well worth the post eats hand scrubbing,4
the food was not all that  the customer service was just okay dont get what all the rave is about,1
this place was terrible the pictures i saw on yelp did not match what was on the menu and the staff was awful to top it off screaming kids and you cant even have a mimosa with your brunch,0
art on the wallsnnart on the platesnni sat at the bar in front of the kitchen i wanted a bite of everything i saw head outnndef a musteat if youre anywhere in or around vegas,4
great service and great food  especially loved the potatoes that came with my eggs benedict and the waffles were fluffy and tasty  finding a parking space is a bit of a challenge,3
great atmosphere even better food we came in for lunch i had the blt with their homemade chips mmm would definitely go back,3
took my first class today the class was awesome but the owners teachers are the sweetest and kind people and thats what makes me want to always go back there when i feel like doing hot yoga,4

yummy so this is what real corn beef hash should look like and taste ive only been here for breakfast now i have to try their lunch  dinner if you go there for breakfast get their early or expect to wait its a small and popular place,3
good portions and cocktails overall the best thing i tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer stay away from the curry chicken it was small and didnt have much chicken in it,2
expensive pool food nothing more,1
the food was good excellent egg rolls wonderful hot and sour soup good pad thai however service was slow and the noise level was harsh we would get take out from her but would not come back to eat here,1
31 different types of crafts on tap  some wines  great food what more can you ask for been here twice in less than a month and will be def going back totally work a try,3
great beer selection  the wings and sauce were out of this world  cool restaurant  loud inside on a busy night,3
amazing food the pop tarts are pretty much the most delicious thing in existence its a weird week if i havent come here at least once and its always consistently wonderful,4
the place was great looking and  the employees were great but the food while plentful every item i had was lukewarm and average in both quality and taste,2
if youre looking for customer service do not go to bacchanal buffet  we hiked the maze to the buffet to show up at 1001 only to be turned away  absolutely no compassion,0
definitely not worth the 35 its decent as far as buffets go hence two stars instead of one but there are so many other places to eat where you wont get ripped off and have decent food,1
heard this was the 1 buffet in vegas the main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny p the last time i was in vegas the bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for 3540 i believe this place was 50nn35 stars but rounded up,3
i so regret purchasing the 24 hour buffet  308 for 2 adults and 1 child to include bacchanal all the other buffets do not compare smaller selection but excellent food and presentation it is one of the best in vegas next time its this place or the m buffet,4
i feel like a pig eating at the trough  thats the kind of food u get from this buffet after 25 hours wait dont waste your time and belly go somewhere else unless you like to be a pig  oink oink oink,0
i could spend days at this buffet so many options and all the food is so tasty the crab legs wontons tacos and dessert were my favorites this is a definite must do when you are in vegas if you want to try a great buffet,4
the desserts failednnfood was good i was really hyped up to go here from the reviewsit was not that amazin but food was good indonesian curries  prime rib  etcsushi was surprisingly fresh for a buffet,2
had lunch buffet last week it was a good meal but still disappointed compared to what i paid also disappointed that the variety of food is far less than what i expected maybe because it was lunch not dinner,2
i picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from yelp  nnthe price is 3599 per personnnoverall the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering  foods are soso  with this kind of price i would go for wicked spoon at least they have good desserts,1
horrible horrible line  worse than disneyland  food is great but after waiting for so long who cares about the food  if youre diabetic you might pass out before you get seated and dont be fooled by your ticket time  theres more waiting after that  go to m resort instead,1
its pretty good tons of food choices and there wasnt a line for us loved the sugar free cheesecake definitely worthy,3
cant express how amazing this dinner buffet was  spending the same amount at another restaurant would only get you 1 dish  a glass of wine  here its all gourmet  as much as you want of whatever you want  awesome cheese great crab legs freshly steamed beautiful  delicious desserts,4
dinner buffet the food look old crab legs and carving station look like some 999 buffets dinner is 5099 but i would not eat here if the price was 20 bucks i was smart enough to ask them to let me check out the food first 5 stars for me,0
first time i tried  it was awesome but this time it is actually not good  they also increase the price for 4th july holiday but the food was worse oysters were not fresh king crabs are small  we were really disappointed for almost 70 a person totally not worth it stay away for good,1
we waited hours to get in by the time we got in i was not hungry i did not see anything exceptional so crowded    i guess if you love crab legs then enjoy but i dont eat that  disappointed and expensive   i rather pay that price and have a nice sit down dinner,0
not bad really clean great desserts liked it over most buffets in vegas,3
not impressed at all  mostly lunch items at breakfast time most of the breakfast items were cold and not very well prepared nnbellagios buffet is much better,1
good food long wait you have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line nnthe crab legs were great but i thought the prime rib was so so they have a great selection of food and desserts and everything ive tried was pretty good,3
this place has a great menu and is also a great time too we basically had appetizers and dessert while we listened to the band this time but the food is delicious too,4
excellent food and service  love this place   we had the enchiladas with steak    the guacamole was yummy too  this is now my favorite mexican resturant,4
emilio is the best hairstylist ive ever had hes done the best color and cut for me i always get compliments after getting my hair done,4

the food is good but the service is miserably slow i go there for lunch on occasion and each time it takes over an hour and i come back late,1
checked this place out while on vacation  the appetizers were dish we had the wings with the citrus habanero sauce right amount of sweet  spice  then we had the pork belly  tomato jam  amazing ordered tacos but i was too stuffed to eat them  would totally go back and just do the apps,3

the food is good but not great the hamburger was very squished inside the aluminum and i would understand that at a fast food place but not in a place where they make it right there and then i loved the fries though,2
when the hot light is on you simply just cant resist helping yourself to a krispy kreme doughnut or 12 the drive thru is fast and convenient and located in the heart of cotswald you really cant go wrong here,4

i ordered a spider roll a lobster roll and uni the rolls tastes delicious especially a spider roll a fried soft crab in the roll was fresh and crispy but for uni it tasted fishy not fresh when i had it maybe you have to ask a waiter about its quality before order it,2
there was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a monday night i stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through i was never greeted or served needless to say i was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing,0
out of business spice asian bistro now occupies this space cant wait to try them out and post my review,0
my husband and i needed new screens and batteries for our cell phones  they were quick to fix the issues and we felt the prices were reasonable   the store itself is a little hidden  its located upstairs in case anyone gets lost,4

jt bartendermanager killed it good music and beer badass cocktails custom made by jt and a little bit of food to snack onwill be back,4
stopped in for a slice with my son large slice of pizza generous toppings a tad on the greasy side but most likely due to the pepperoni  all in all thought it was good  food came out quickly will stop in an try something else next time oh yea no fountain drinks for me a negative,2
i really liked the environmentatmosphere at peculiar rabbit but the food was average and the menu was limited  i feel like this place does not really have an identity yetnnbasically i dont feel an urge to come back here for anything more than some beers,1
peculiar rabbit is quite peculiar the fare here is quite inventive especially love the sweet tea brined wings sweet tea and truffle fries not a fan of the deviled eggs have came a number of different times although i would say the customer service has not always been the best here,2
not a fan of the entrees so much they are too salty for me but the frozen custard is always great,2

place was disgusting couldnt even sit down anywhere for a drink trash and leftover food everywhere who knows how often wait staff cleans upnnwalked in walked out,0
35 starnngreat neighborhood bar for a casual gettogether the food is ok and this trip we had great service good clean spot to down a beer or two and roll on,2
its a fun place to go with a big group of friends with indoor and outdoor bar seating i really enjoy sitting back on the patio the blood orange margarita is my most preferable drink the food there is decent the service is as well,2
something was missingnusual suspects on tapnleaves more to desire,2

get coffee terrible taste and barely even warm pay for my coffee and my wifes hot chocolate get change back which the guy drops on the counter for me to grab and doesnt say anything next time youll be picking up your teeth off the counter learn better customer service,0
nice decor great service very very mediocre sushi sashimi was ok but all of the rolls from basic to specialty were very muddled many other sushi options in clt for way less,1
great bagels yummy coffee friendly service the only reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars is they get slowed down significantly by only having one toaster sometimes it takes a very long time to get my order other than that its great,3
cute little cakecrepe shop good place to go for a dessertnni tried the greentea cake  it was delicious it was layered with azuki cream filling nthey had all sorts of pastries strawberry shortcake cream puffs custard pudding etc nnnext time im definitely going to try their crepes it looked so yummy,3
their desserts are very light its not super sweet so if youre looking for a sugar overload this is not the place the strawberry milli crepe cake is delicious the strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well id highly recommend both im looking forward to trying more desserts in the future,4
dont know why people think its great service is whatever and the crepe and pastries arent even good and the ice cream amount is freaking small the only reason why i give it two stars is cuz of the two cute girls that i saw not amazing in my opinion had better crepes and pastries,1
still the only place in the world i have been where i can get hot milk tea infused with red bean and mung bean flavor heaven,4

hate  nothingnndislike  nothingnnlike  the spinach curry the chicken cutlet the sides offered the pleasant service the close proximity to other local favorite spotsnnlove  nothing,3
i love the curry here it has a homemade taste  you can taste the vegetables melted into the curry broth so subtle i love the simplicity of the menu too the curry broth is the main ingredient of course and then you can add a topping genuine service too,3
great atmosphere and the food is good for anybody who is willing to try curry the service is great the curry isnt watered down like many places who serve curry this place is just up the alley if you want a thick curry curry plate,4
fair prices including kids size and great specialty flavors saw them  first friday and it was definitely a great stop on a hot june day quick and friendly service with a smile they drive their truck to many locations so call and see where they are located and go get one of their shaved ice treats,3
prices are not really any better than wal mart clean  good selection,2
good family restaurant,3
this place looks much better on the inside than out  good pizza they offer pizza by the slice at lunch but the menu is a bit over priced   pretty good tv coverage so it could be a decent watering hole in south charlotte  ill be back,2

we ate here lastnminute this was the only place open late on a sunday and im glad that we ended upnhere the vibe is modern and comfortable very spacious and the food is more than bomb the lisa lisa roll is a must i would definitely eat here again esp since i visit monthly,4
sushi quality is not as good as the picture very disappointed the fish on the sushi is slim and thin it is worst than other 3 star restaurant  so i cant believe it got four star,1
its not the worst option for fast food style airport food they have veggie tacos that provide reasonable portions and nice scoops of guacamole the rice is awful and the salsa is more like pizza sauce although its affordable and quick,2
it looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat chinese food i have ever had in montreal i tried the mango chicken general tao chicken dondon noodles sweet and sour soup and the spicy sour potatoes all excellent friendly service too,4
had a great experience with sixt out of sky harbor  starting with the beautiful and wonderful antonia who greeted me at the counter i had a new convertible for a great price no wait in line or to get the car bringing it back was just as easy everyone was wonderful thanks all,4

the bad uncomfortable seating nnthe good amazing food ordered level 4 and added hot sauce as needed i must have burned off my taste budsand liked every moment,3
food was 710 however the service was absolutely atrocious  the place is understaffed and nobody took our order or even offered to get us drinks for 15 minutes the couple sitting next to us had been waiting even longer  this is such a shame for a restaurant to be held back its service of all things,0
service was excellent but food was just okay,2
i dont come in often  the bar scene isnt my thing but i can always count on morgan in the kitchen to cook up some deliciousness  i havent been let down by the menu yet  thanks,4

went in there on a sunday with four people working and two other clients in there only asked for a pedi and gel manicure they had me soaking in cold water for 30 minutes without them checking on me or notifying me of a wait before i just left,0
best food in anthem been going here for years and food has been consistently delicious these folks take pride in what they do and it shows i hope someday they open a bigger place yum,3
the fries are the best  this place just isnt as clean as it used to be starting to look like a chinese buffet they have changed managers a lot since they opened,0

food was okay but coming from socal ive had better for less than half the price the margaritas were awesome but for 16 they better be i probably wouldnt come back here again too expensive,2

nothing but good things to say about project pie pizza is delicious fresh and reasonably priced i consider them to be a gem and make it my first stop in vegas,4
i wish id has as good an experience as others with this cafe  my bacon was burned and the coffee smelled and tasted burned as well  this cafe is priced higher and the food quality is lower than other breakfast eateries in the area  i certainly wont be back,0
fast and fresh breakfast i like the simple things for breakfast sometimes and they do a great job at it will definitely be back,3
uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost morebut rofl wow theres a reasonable point in paying for something nnto be dramaticits like paying 10 for a piece of gum,1
i was pleasantly surprised by my lunch here the other day  i had the turkey ham and brie sandwich and it was delicious  the service was friendly and ill be back the next time im in the area,3
service was just ok better than the last time ordered a burger medium well got a rare burger way over priced mediocre food drinks were good once we got them,1
im sitting at the bar at this moment and have been sitting here for 20 minutes now and havent been greeted by a single bar tender waitress or any staff at all,0
you definitely get your moneys worthonly 14 i in a hurry is say its worth it but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care ofid go somewhere else,1

excellent customer service brendon provided great service very personablenwould definitely recommend this place very efficient,4
the pho hit me at the right spot after an insane hangover also they definitely challenged me with the size of that bubble tea one problem though what is up with that tapioca either they are not boiling it right or just getting the wrong brand but with everything else i am quite satisfied,3
it was an okay place to eat at the restaurant was kind of small to me also my friend got their food before me so i had to wait and watch them eat before i got my food,1
the food is delicious but my only concern would be the customer service ive been there a few timestwice ive been ignored waiting to make an order while waiting in the front all i see is the employees having a nice chat with another table,1
so glad this place is open again fresh cut meat and cheese with fresh bread straight from the bakery,3
beautiful lit scenery using wire and colorful silk amazed us as we walked through the scenery  very impressive   see my picturesnnif you are in montreal this is a must see  check dates and times as it is a yearly temporary event,4
fantastic shrimp poboy  the ingredients were really fresh the bread was soft and tasty the shrimp crispy and the sauce was delicious  it will be hard getting anything else  ill have to though since their other dishes look great as well,4
drinks are great  wide selection of tequilas and tequila flights  food is soso weve had dinner several times at the wedge trying different items and have never been impressed,2
i didnt know what to expect but i couldnt stop laughing the entire time i loved the show,4
i agree with what so many others have written here about hypnosis unleashed this show is a highenergy hilarious blast that left me in tears several times because i was laughing so much kevin lepine is a true showman and host and a terrific hypnotist recommended,4

me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry the stuffed ball i had was empty the pesto was bland the chef needs to be given salt and pepper neather me or my wife will be back,0
i think the employees at this location are fairly friendly for the most part though i love most of their selection i do think some of their items are high priced i would love to buy more supplements or vitamins but i simply cant afford it i think their free range meat options are lacking,2
killer menu one of my favorite dining experiences in las vegas our waiter spent time with us and knew every little detail about the restaurant and the menu ill be backmany times,4
the food was fine but not amazing  the decor is done very well  the problem is that the service is so incredibly slow that even if the food was 5 star the overall experience would still be average,2
food was delicious ambiance top notch fun classy decor to look at everywhere you turn our server was super attentive and ready with menu suggestions and recommendations we will absolutely be back and bring our friends,4
i got ripped off  granted i didnt bring my confirmation number with me they could not find my reservation at the gate and when i called customer service since date had passed  no refund was available will not use the internet to  pay for parking again  i am pissed that i got screwed out of 2800,0
great to have a new gas station next to my folks place  price is just right,3
the food was delicious i had the hanger steak and tony had the clams he ate every single one,3
as a resident of south scottsdale this is a true gem  the food is fresh and crazy good  they are creative and farm to table i believe is truly what they are  the cocktail program is spot on if you want to enjoy true craft spirits  the service is 5 star and you never get disappointed,4
milunka is great at her craft  i had my first facial with her and shes amazing she did extractions which i needed and now my skin feels fantastic,4
milunka is wonderful  she wants to know about your skin and she wants to educate you about your skin  shes so sweet and nice i truly appreciate her taking her time when i got my facial she is great at extractions she doesnt try to push her products on you i will be returning to her again and again,4
half my nails were filed square and the other round they dont know what they are doing waste of money,0

we ate breakfast here and my toast was cold my potatoes were cold and my hot tea water was barely warm the only choice of jelly they had was grape and i dont like grape we are locals and we will not try this place again i am sure it will probably be out of business soon anyway,1
my husband and i have eaten chinese food all over phoenix and hands down big wa has been the best  the bbq pork with fresh spicy mustard is amazing  we have ordered about 6 different dishes from here sometimes totally blind and the food is always great,4
very small and crowded the most fun we had was taking a picture with a sexy zebra man,1
ive been in this store a few times but mostly all at night or early am i have never have had any issues with service its conventionally located to home its open 247  has most things one may need prices are a little more expensive vs walmart but you pay for the convenience,2
this use to be one of my all time favorite stores but it has changed soo much the quality for some shirts or dress and pants is not worth the price everything is now like vail material they use to have quality what happened,1
the 440 sandwich with sweet potato fries is one of my favorite lunches the salads are also great and i cant wait to try the pasta dishes and i willone of these daysnni really like this location because it seems quicker and less crowded than the one on hualapai,3
what a disaster not the food but the service i would immediately fire the management 50 minutes of hell waiting for food which never arrived asked for a refund will never go back if you see a line leave as the management is a disorganized mess,0
most likely will not visit again overpriced for what you get slow service and cold food is unacceptable when there was one order before us,1
when we sat down we had to wait for 5 minutes before our server showed up  we decided to order everything all at once and our food came but didnt have napkins or silverware  we didnt see our server for about 10 min  next time im just going to order takeout  crappy service,0
great spacious dinning area for family friends and co workers pizza was delivered in a timely maner 20min prices are reasonable here courteous waiters and clean restaurant,3
gag  this place is no good  the worst sushi i have ever had  honestly we ordered a yellow roll and the fish was so old i was gagging and couldnt even swallow  we told the sushi chef and they didnt do anything  they said they would take 1 off  boo for bad fish and boo for bad service,0
not impressed  i had barbacoa and carne asada tacos  they were bland and small  nothing special,1

i guess since they have the cheapest cash price for gas here in las vegas you dont need to have a nice personality the guys here are just plain dicks one of them smelled of alcohol too,0
rip off 279 with car wash otherwise 309 what a ripngas down the street is only 279 without the car wash  ice   drive further its worth it,0
a delightful waiterexcellent mango mojitosa most interesting appetizera delectable pan bread very good entrees  whats not to like  although the restaurant is in the pima crossings strip mall the owner has done an excellent job with the internal decor,3
the food was ok nothing special but the service was horrible the waitress forgot to give us menus first if all then i didnt get a drink refill not once then the bill was 100 bucks for 7 people  so not worth the money im not a cheap person but i refuse to pay for bad service,1
great service reasonably priced,4
love this place teresa did an amazing job taking care of 30 pain in the butt engineers with grace thank you so much,3

pretty cool sports bar with great tv coverage had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey,3
it gets pretty crowded in there around lunch but the subs and prices are really good and well worth the wait they are pretty good size sub versus anything you would get at jimmy johns or any other generic sub shop,4
sat for twenty minutes before someone arrived at the table service very slow meal arrived having sat under a heat lamp steak ordered medium rare was now dry and well done eggs were dead wine list had nice selection,1

mediocre thai food go here if you want a cheap meal but not for much else i will allow that i didnt try the oburger side of the restaurant but if the burgers look anything like the posters they had up it was a good call on my part,1
nope not that great seriouslynnfor a 175 for a very small taco not worth the price everything here is actually overpriced people have told me to just eat the tacos not the plates burritos tostadas etc cause you might get food poisoningnneh i would ratehr go to another taco place down the street,0
pretty much meh  it wasnt terrible but nothing worth making a special trip for  i tried the al pastor and lengua tacos  the pastor was a little dry and lacked the usual sweetness  the lengua was tender but didnt have enough seasoning or something just kind of bland,1
dry carne asada and stale chipsno buenonwith la bonita meat market in the same shopping center you would belive this restaurant would at least try to keep upi rather go there for lunchsorry vatos just being honest,0
no bueno sorry  customer service not friendly at all we did get a welcome at least best asada fries my foot i order asadasteak  but  the asada felt like rubber bands pastor tacos so so but tortillas hard the only good thing was the salsas i really dont think im coming back,1
drink service is fast sandwichbagel service is so slow one wonders if they are getting stuff from other close paradise bakery best to stop at copperheads instead,1

this place has reasonable prices they have a large selection of food here the satay chicken is very dry it was difficult to eat i liked the pineapple fried rice  i had 3 helpings of it their thai tea is pretty sweet the phat thai was good too their green curry paste fried rice was really spicy,3
we came in for restaurant week and will be back the menu was excellent and service warm and friendly yeah a bit heavy on the white hair crowd but that is just fine with me i am there to enjoy a great meal,3
it was cool  lots of stores and prices were ok at most of the places  biggest  complaint  where is the roof we live in a oven we need ac also where is the food court at a subway is all they have you are forced to drive over  to west gate or just  leave,3
great place to shop at a lot of different stores to choose from  parking is fairly easy especially when its not during holiday seasons or early morning and early afternoon on week days,3
very nice staff clean and modern decor i believe they take all insurances dr hanks has a great bedside manner,4
yes this place is fast but the front desk staff suck at customer service the most unfriendly girls full of attitude i will not come to this location ever again,0
cheap gas on the western edge of town,3

chelsea was phenomenal we came in for a birthday had great service custom cocktails made for everyone in our party and chelseas knowledge of early 90s music was the cherry on top of the sundae definitely will be coming back,4
so simple yet so good they let you build your own bowl of ramen with your choice of meats broth and many add ons for about a dollar like a hard boiled egg or vegetables a little pricey though typically a bowl of noodle soup was like 911 without any add ons but it is still a definite must try,3
expensive but food is consistent and pretty filling ive had alot better ramen but in pittsburgh choices are limited people so if ramen is what youre craving this is the de facto place,2
love this place the ice cream is perfect and the cute atmosphere adds to the experience ive only tried a couple of flavors but they were delicious,4
by far the best place for ice cream  make sure to stop here  amazing ice cream and great service,4
freezer burnt mediocre at best ice cream wont be back,0
while the service was good when i pu my takeout i found the food to be average at best  general lings chicken was pei wei copycat and the tomatillo salad was only slightly more interesting  im sure there are better things on the menu but 1st impression does not push me to revisit any time soon,1
everyone seems to have a problem with this place but i enjoyed some of the best fried rice of my life here and my friend got some sort of popular asian chicken dish and loved it didnt think it was overpriced and our server was great,3
meh the location and the venue is great but the food is only okay  i liked the drinks though creative,1
the broth is weak and theres a funny taste in the meatballs the one on rainbow used to be one of my favorites the food quality and flavor have really slipped with the expansion much better pho one block either way,0
i went on easter sunday because most places were packed one of the worst places ive been to their food was terrible and was just overwhelming and we asked what the waiter thought was good but it wasnt wat we hoped for,0

we like the soup but service is always a little slow but the make your own soup choice is nice for picky eaters,2
went from an a to a b and now to a c wasnt displaying the grade for awhile now they have their c up im one of over 16 calls to the health board im told,1
update i went back again at a later time the place was pretty empty nservice was slow and kinda bad i think the person was new and didnt really know what to do nthere was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown nwould never be going back,0
most disgusting sushi ever  as each dish came forward on the conveyor belt it was like watching some bizarre game of chance  not really knowing if the next bite was going to make you sicker,0
the last time i was here it wasnt as bad as i remembered it to be in the past when you come here be prepared to wait and hour or two before you can leave also expect  below average customer service and bring some water and snacks lol you are welcome,1
the driver daniel was early to the pickup so there was no pressure on the drive he was courteous and helpful i called other cabs to compare prices and they were by far the cheapest to the airport great value indeed,4
dropped by here to watch this is the end  the theater was huge the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable  i will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area  also this place has bowling pool and eateries  give this place a try if in the area,4
good location in the airport but the food was sub par not houstons like the hillstone chain,1
had an amazing trip with these guys  total pros who love what they do and it shows  highly recommend,4
not worth it,0
as good and friendly dr suarez is  the frontdesk is awful unfriendly and just forget if you need anything  you will die trying to get if from this staff trying for years  to overlook it as the doctor is great  but it is getting unacceptable and actually pretty costly to pay for their mistakes,0
never had anything like it very impressed with the different spin on shaved ice  lots of variety  swanky and new decoration  date night worthy well definitely be back,4
ive been here twice and both times they have run out of cups it is very maddening please have more cups i do have to say the shaved ice is really good but im really just interested in the boba,3
got a small taro snow with red bean and condensed milk and it was delicious i thought it was actually pretty big for a small but would be good for sharing also got a thai iced tea with boba the boba has great consistency and tastes just right,4
i have ate here at least 7 times never been disappointed the food is fresh and the price is so low its rare to find that love the chicken tortas here,4
i tried to go here to get a bite to eat and have a smithwicks  theres a fridge with premade sandwiches and no smithwicks  i dont think you can call yourself an irish pub just because one of the 6 beers you have on tap is a guinness  i ended up going somewhere else,0
great selection my husband is the cook in our family and is obsessed with the fantastic selection of olive oils this means i get to try some tasty dishes and sample some of the wonderful oils this shop has to offer,4

i came here with a group for drinks before a group dinnerdidnt like that you couldnt seat yourself at the bar without the hostess helping you  we tried some drinks and french friesall were good albeit overpriced but nothing to rush back for,2
horrible greasy flavorless and overpriced captain ds makes better fish than this place dont waste your money,0
very disappointedcalamari was salty  cesar salad had a bottle dressing not good overall food was average not worth the premium price,1
had the beef and vegetable pot pie and spotted dic for dessert it was so amazing i would eat here every day if i could,4
food was good staff is friendly but i think pricing is way to high for pub food,2
great food  miserable service  the food is outstanding and reasonably priced for a brand name chef restaurant on the strip  the service was slow and inattentive  not a positive experience even wit wonderful dishes,1
food is good if you stick to the core of their menu  they also have a good beer selection  great atmosphere for kids because it is loud  biggest complaint is the hostesses they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table,2
the service was awesome i called them last second for an order of chocolate dipped strawberries and they were able to get them for me,4
loved this place the food is amazing and the deserts are yummy they even made a grilled cheese sandwich for my 3 year old daughter which was not on the menu weve been to this place twice and will continue to come even though it is across town from us,4

food is always consistently deliciousdont let the location fool you food is great and pricing is very reasonablethe nachos are a great choice meat is always cooked perfect and the portion is more than enough for two people,4
steak was not cooked to order  server acted like she did not care  appetizer to share was small and not that good side mac and cheese was great,1
nasty id rather spend a little more for better quality food this is one step up from applebees,0
hallelujah finally a real margherita pizza in vegas fresh mozzarella fresh toppings great crustif you like pizza hut or frozen pizza from a box this place is not for you if you have a palette and like homemade food and not mcdonalds try this place very reasonable prices too,4
best pizza available in the nwcentennial area  the ambiance is still developing but the food is great,4
i have eaten a ton of pizza in my time this is one of the best it has a great fresh taste the dough has a good chew to it and the toppings are exceptionaln the chopped salad i get every time no exceptions us the best i have ever had hands down n granted it is not cheap but more than worth it,4
it was my first time to eat here and thought it was a nice little pizza place  they cook the pizzas in a big ceramic open fire oven i enjoyed the pepperoni pizza and the margarita pizza,2
i personally love panera their food is different and tasty love the steak sandwich at breakfast frozen caramels are delicious and staff is great,3
not even worth a review will not spend any energy on corporate scum that steals from the poor spirit airlines of the bus industry mixed with soul plane  waste of 39 bucks if theres ever a class action lawsuit im in,0

465 excellent sandwich got the italian and was very impressed by the quality of the meat they used come hungry the 12 inch here is a lot more food than the 12 inch at subway says voted best sandwich in america definitely a contender,4
great donuts bad service  ive been there three times ordered the same donuts 6 gourmet and was charged 3 different prices  when i told the salesperson she had an attitude  this review is for the store at town square  thanks to the service im not going back,1
have not been at night but based off a traditional coffee shop its not conducive to studying food items seem interesting although i have not tried any,2
friendly staff hot food clean  this place is always busy and a great bargain especially during baseball season when the dbacks make 6 runs one more,4
everything was mediocre  you are better off going to burger bar or carls jr to fill your burger needs,0
fantastic  the farm burger was fabulous and the sweet potato fries with powder sugar were great huge fan of food  service on the hand was slow they forgot our fries and we had to ask for them and did not get them until we were 34 done with our burgers,3
had a great time  great food there is usually a significant wait 3060 mins  be prepared to wait,4
burgers look great but been here 22 min and still waiting for fries and the place is dead with a ton of staff hope the burgers are worth it they were the burgers were amazing and so were the fries 3 stars because the wait was horrible,2
there is a long wait but it is well worth it i ordered the jalapeu00f1o poppers pork burger and the truffle parmesan fries everything was absolutely amazing definitely some if the best food ive ever had finish everything off with an oreo shake,4
it was a great burger but the price tag doesnt support what you get 2 burgers 1 order of onion rings and a drink  75 bucks not this guy,2
excellent burgers could do without the fries definitely try the burgers here they might take a while but they are worth the wait good service as well,3
look  its nothing more than a 13aburger burger joint pretty nice burger not the best,2
im definitely a fan of gordon ramsey i had the hells kitchen burger and it was delicious but their fries and onion rings may need a revisit from gordon ramsey  but overall its a great experience,3
my husband and i split a farm burger and sweet potato fries and were completely full the burger was delicious and the fries were really good as well we even got to see hells kitchen winner christina who is the head chef there now it was very exciting since we are big fans of ramsey and his shows,4
there seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side but they had the best burgers ive ever had the onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times ive had in vegas,3
nothing special about these burgers 14 for a cheeseburger,1
you dont have to wait in line if youre a platinum member  the whole menu is  cheaper if you are a platinum total rewards member  the chicken burger is to die for the fries are also really good  the burgers look small nut they are filing,4
tons of seating same great pizza lunch special is one of the best around,4
i have only been to barros for lunch but i have always had a good meal  i usually get a sausage  slice of the day bbq chicken and they are both terrificnntwo slices of pizza  a soda for about 5 is a great deal and the bbq chicken pizza is excellent,4
i like this store plenty of space to walk lots of different produce organic cosmetics and supplements if i would have more money i would shop only there definitely,4
go see this shownwe were sceptical as the movie was terrible  i am so happy we went  the narrator was so funny  very funny  great musiclove,4
still no communication from toca they obviously do not care about their customers oh thats right we are not customers we are patients i was corrected by their staff thanks for pointing that out,0
had my toyota truck s water pump transmission and radiator replaced last summer by this shop thought the water pump might of been leaking and even though the wait was over 2 hours long the new shop manager seem too perform all necessary tests to make sure it wasnt so far so good,3
good price on full synthetic oil change and its quick and easy and got my tires rotated for free  need some other things done they said but seemed a little spendy,3
friendly service and tasty pie i try to grab a bite here everytime i fly through sky harbor,3
decided to try again i dont know why pizza is actually okay but the service is so inadequate that cant endorse this place the cashier didnt give correct change and simply cant be bothered with customers and last time i had no cheese on my pizza guess ill go out of my way to humble pie next time,0
just avoid this place if you cann other place offers better,1
the food has great presentation but the decor is drabby and needs to be more lively with more style the tuna poke was excellent as well as the cookie with ice cream i would go back for more food to enjoy,3
my bibimbop was good and it was served in a normal bowl like i expected i didnt expect a hot pot because its not listed as dolsot on the menu the kimchi was also good the server was pleasant and the price was 10 which is reasonable im glad i can get bibimbop in my neighborhood,3
terrible terrible food,1
everything served in or on styrofoam tasteless overpriced  my refrigerator has a bad smell in it from the leftovers,0
the food is good but im disappointed at the stinginess  they give plastic ware but i ask for 4 paper plates and was told i have to pay a dollar a piece really horrible business practice over something like plates,1
great little tacos on fremont st carne asada tacos and spanish rice were good cheep eats and open late,3
i didnt have any food here but the service was awesome and the bloody mary is super spicy and delicious,2
its sad when you can say that dennys has a better chicken fried steak but it is the truth the gravy was bland and the steak was like cardboard  maybe if they had tabasco to add some flavor it wouldnt have been so bad but they dont have tabasco  i did enjoy the mimosa,1
i loved the ice coffee and everything ive ordered here has been fantasticnis my go to breakfast joint while in this area,3
people there were all unfriendlynfood was undercooked and served coldnwaitress was rudenpancakes tasted like bleachnwater tasted like sewer waternwe never got any drink refillsntable was dirty when we sat down and we asked if it could be wiped off it never wasndo not waste your money on this place,0
it must be a vegas thing but you cannot beat a store that servers adult slurpies the service is quick and you are on your way to explore the main drag with drink in hand keep your container and you will save a dollar or two on your refill it is also a small way to save the planet,4
this placeis awesome very convenient and the subs are so good love their special sauce great bread the staff was very nice too will be back soon,4
michael is absolutely the most amazing dog sitter that you could ever have the pleasure of meeting i recommend him to all of my friends not only is he a great dog sitter but he is also a wonderful human being,4
this company was supposed to send an academic book to my brother after failing to do so we drove to the branch in phoenix where a staff member complained about how she was supposed to off the clock nnwe waited so long for the package once we got there how unprofessional,0
there are some tables and a lot of slot machines if you live in the area it could be a good place to go and hang out i would never recommend a drive from the strip to gamble here but not bad for a locals hang out with dollar beer and hot dogs how can you go wrong,2
this has become my favorite hotel off the strip the rooms are great and make you feel at home  this hotel smells awesome and during christmas time they have pine scented air freshener through out the lobby  our family has stayed here about 4 times now and its been our goto hotel when visiting,4
meh is about the perfect way to describe this place first its too expensive i know its vegas on the strip but improve quality if youre going to have such high cost food was okay at best with so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one,1
no customer service at all none zero nada zilch,1
not sure if i would come back 1st they mixed up our order with someone else so we had to wait for them to make it again their carne asada quesadillas had very little meat their gorditas looked like 2 tortillas slap together the only thing i would recommend was the carne asada tacos,1
these were the best tacos on the east side that ive had very authentic and inexpensive nice people and the place is very clean the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puru00e9ed i like it chunky but that is no bug deal i highly recommend people to try this place,4
those were some tasty tacos also the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot ive been to in phoenix or san diego,4
the tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth thenprice waited a long time and got some really small tacosni would not go there again for sure,0
expensive for what it is burger 6oz fries and soda over 10 bucks the fries were 240 and not for a five guys portion either n service was slow too and the place was not packed out i predict they will not last long like johnnie bruscos,1
fast service  great food and excellent beer beeeeer beeeeeeeeeeeeeer they should stay open later though 1030pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol,3
under construction when i visited small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures also a selection of fangoria and similar magazines kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction they also sold some snacks and drinks,2
the one downtown has amazing customer service but i do not recommend shopping at the goodyear location three workers were literally standing around the front door chatting and completely oblivious,0
horrible bartender at this place most people grab drinks before trying the menu this guy behind the bar made me wanna skip the menu rude and unwelcoming were the first impressions angelo sosa get rid of this guy your food deserves it 2 stars for the foodzero for the bar,1
great for the beer but not for the food you get what you pay for food wise great prices on beer and decent selectionnni had the fried macaroni brick and it was mostly forgettablennthe big plus is the very nice and large flat screen tvs all over the place,1
from a chicagoanwow pretty damn good deep dish pizza  they did forget my salad dressings for the salads but fuck it didnt really want to waste good stomach real estate on salad anyway very very very good  will be going back for the chicago dog and italian beef sandwiches,3
windy city beef n pizza is a lot of fun the food is decent ive never been to chitown but it seems to represent it well if im in the mood for a hot dog or slice of deep dish pizza i know where to go,2
went here with a buddy and had a blast not much experience shooting guns but the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable,4
initiation fees  whynsimilar to you fit who says 10 a month look out for the hidden feesni went by this new gym when it opened with a coupon i received in the mail and the management refused to honor itnni go to tangible fitness locally owned no hidden fees  reasonable monthly rates,0

jackie did an absolutely amazing job on my maternity photos i had never had photos done before  and she gladly helped me with where to put my hands what poses to do which outfits looked better  etc i am so excited about how they turned out and cant wait to go back for some newborn photos,4
skip this place cheap sushi sure but not very good at all just go to ta on happy hour and you get so much better quality for only a little bit more and so much more variety,1
i think this is the best sushi place ever i like to go there for lunch all the time and honestly i thought stingray sushi was good but this place blows it off the water,4
food is way to greasy for me but if you like deep fried junk food this is the place for you,0
was great but tried to go today and its closed it says they are converting it to an event room,4
u00c9vitez ce resto le dimanche si vous u00eates un groupe de 6 ou plus minimum 90 minutes dattente  mauvaise gestion des tables,1
delicious filling healthy i will be back,4
i loved this place i wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced but they were really reasonable a lot of different styles to choose fromnwe didnt get any fries because they were 4 and a small portion drinks were pricey too nbut ill definitely go back for the hotdogs,4
it was ok over priced for some rogies they were good but not the best ive ever had  ill give this place another chance tho i really like the fact that they are open until 2 on weekends,2
came here for a drink while waiting for a table at the restaurant across the street and honestly am thinking of staying friendly laidback atmosphere the memphis dog we shared to tide us over was delish just wish wed noticed the church wine punch on the bar menu before ordering it looks so good,4
food is great i eat here a few times a week and never get sick of it the juices are good too make sure you pick up a frequent diner card,4
a bit overpriced both chicken and tri tip bowl were good but very dry  this place also does not have a friendly vibe  its pretty pretentious  good intention with healthy food but smug is in the air,1
keep it up  delicious  as new yorkers we were very skeptical but pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food,3
overpriced decor is lousy customer service is less than friendly  dont waste your time here  food is just ok,1
took my daughters there for girls day out  the decore is ok i wish i could say the same thing for the food and or the service   my daughters are grown with their own families  none of us will be returning,1
best carpet cleaning company ive ever used luiz is the owner and operator and hes amazing hes friendly and fairhonest on price the machines they use actually work unlike other companies they actually scrub the carpets clean great work eco fresh highly recommended,4

by far the worst and most overpriced pizza ive ever experienced  if you want pizza just like this but want to get away cheap buy the pizza from sams club seriously  im from ny and this is not what you find on the streets of ny,0
audio assault in the form of bulgarian post modern industrial techno merely a guess it was like a jackhammer to my brain very small space for such crazy loud music i saw some glow sticks come out scanned for pacifiers and we bailed from the choice words i could make out our bartender was friendly,1
very good food i had the al pastor tacos my mom had the carne asada ones both had great flavor the guacamole was okay basic nothing super special but it was very fresh the house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic i would definitely recommend going here,3
i think yelp really let me down this time in my opinion i think the bar is just trying to be a restaurant the service was somewhat slow arizona has way better mexican food places than this joint the chips were stale and the guacamole was bland with a chunky twist,0
had the breakfastpoutine  6 stars if i couldnif you like to compartmentalize your plates then might not be for you if you like to mix everything up into one tastebud orgasmic dish one word  the breakfast poutine okay thats three words and a punctuation but yeah you get the picture,4
i like this place for the most part but dont make the mistake of offering the eggs benidict it is sourer  the poor lemon in it,1
this is not fine art photography  having money and friends to comment and say it is does not make it so  i have seen better pictures on tablets and phones  the video is laughable and so amateur its pathetic  look at some real photographers and artists before launching this joke of a gallery,0
currently at fastmed its been close to two hours and still no doctor or pa or whoever to see me only 3 people when i got here in waiting room definitely would not recommend this place too sssssllllloooowwww,0
genuine waitstaffngood greasy burger and friesngreat funky feeling,3
busylunch crowd they make killer chicken strips at least its not mystery meat good location next to twin peaks at concord mills seems to be a busy busy area as of late 4 bars added  a adam and eve and hotels just down the road what more can you ask for,4
this is the worst sushi place ive ever been to in my life taste awful service was so slow one waitress one sushi chef will never ever go back or recommend this place,0
the sushi is really good but its kinda pricy the customer service is kinda weird too overall its a decent place to go though,3

horrible service no one had any idea what was going on overpriced everything took forever to come out will definitely not return,1
this place has a very pleasant environment lots of tvs  patio area is very well connected to the inside of the restaurant service is good but the best of all is the food  every dish i order is good and for appetizer the fried caramelized brusselsprouts are the best,4
the best around cant beat the prices  friendly service very clean i go by whenever possible if you want a sandwich or a snack gas or even a car wash go by  they even have crushed ice for soft drinks,4
dream swirls is pretty awesome i like the toppings frozen yogurt and cookie dough how could it not be 5 stars,4
food was great had a standard burger with the salty dulce de leche shake staff was super cool and will be back to try the short rib tacos for sure,3
killer shakes salted dulce de leche is my fav delicious burgers and tacos  takes a while to get your food but so worth it,3
just wanted to update the review by saying that i have been in with multiple people frequently   the quality and consistency of service and product has been on point every time keep it up,4
great burgers good fries and amazing guacamole probably the best ive ever had from a restaurant the wait is kinda long but worth it because you know its bring made to order the only reason i didnt give 5 stars its because they forgot my bacon oh well though it was still amazing,3
really satisfied with the manner in which jeremy and team take care of our 34 acre yard prompt thorough knowledgeable dependable good communicator we are very pleased,4

after my knee replacement surgery they were too aggressive and i have since had to get a manipulation done,0
couldnt be any more satisfy with gustavos work same day service he repaired my carpet at a reasonable price and quick thanks,4

buddhist bowl  awful the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients  asked for extra spicy instead of cooking with peppers they give a container of hot sauce  manchu wok was 10x better,0
had the summer berry salad with chicken and it was delicious my only complaint is that the large salad was not that large and 16 so it is a bit pricey but everything on the menu looked so good i cant wait to try more,3
glad to c another restaurant with some raw food options  would be nice if they had some fresh pressed green juices and some raw salad options,2
not sure what all of the fuss is about overpriced foods that i can make at home the only thing i would actually pay for again is the green smoothie oh and the jicama fries are terrible,2

great experience fredie g is always so helpful with both my husbands  my car he always tries to get us the best deal with our major fixes this is our goto spot so much so we even opened a firestone credit card thank you fredie for your exceptional customer service  tricia  tony,4
they were so extremely helpful i had a million questions about my hair and wigs  vs my hair and extensions and she was very informative,4
i have to say some items are overpriced the bubble tea is nice the food is ok for me,2
the performers are amazingly talented the songs made my body shake with excitment i notice that there were a total of about 6 people under the age of 55 price is reasonable teather is small and intimate which makes it for a good view from pretty much anywhere you seat nsandra,4
fantastic place great decor and great fooddrinks very different from what ive seen anywhere else puts you in that perfect mood to eat drink and just hang try the sonju yogurt alcoholic drink youll thank me for that one killer well done guys,3
drinks were good but they need to work on their anju serving deep fried prefrozen costco purchased item is not going to cut it,1
we got a groupon to try out this place service was awful and the staff totally ignored us food was alright but over priced it was a 30 groupon however we only received 28 credit on the bill for the service alone we will definitely never go back,0
my 10 year old boys had fun  a little pricey but it is clean well lit and not too loud  for the adultsthe wifi blows the food is not very good and expensive  a small iced latte was just under 5  cant bring anything in eitherand pepsi productsicknnall attractionsgames were in good working condition,3
good wings they always have drink specials,2
the skimpiest wings ive ever seen offered under the nny banner dont waste your money or time   sorry i took my sons here for their first lesson in buffalo wings,0
brand new location staff was friendly and helpful look forward to shopping here often,4
dishonest establishment waitresses are shady stripper shady always check your bill,1
came here with my wife for a sunday breakfast very close to where we live service was very friendly and the food was delicious i had the corned beef hash and my wife had the 2 eggs your way with pancakes nice modern decor and friendly atmosphere,3
the food and service was excellent i left feeling highly satisfied and will absolutely be coming here again to fulfill sushi cravings i especially recommend the calamari,4
this theater is so dang busy i understand it is in the middle of town square and all but it has a vibe to it that makes me feel unwelcome it really isnt for locals unless absolutely convenient or necessary the seats are nice and the prices are high except for the 5 tues movies,1
excellent salads you cant beat this level of quality and service for these prices and convenience they were even nice to our dog that they saw in the car they are restaurant quality,4
really loved it went there today for my first time had always wanted to try it i go there and i ordered everything was perfect when i got home huge portion for the price love everything and will be back very soon i also took my dog and the lady at the window gave her a biscuit  a in my book,3
i cannot get enough of salad n go nnif they maintain all of their same standards as the original gilbert location at all of the expansion locations their growth will be epicnnthe caesar salad with double order of add on prawns is amazing lightly tossed with dressing,4
love it my favorite is the greek with steak soooo good i go at least 12 times a week,4
food was great and the employees were great  no free beverage refills though  i was hoping id get a little more pork also,2
new living pools is ran in a very honest and highly efficient way  chris is one of the best in the business and knows what he is doing when it comes to pools  i highly recommend new living pools and guarantee you will not be disappointed,4
i would stay as far away from this place as possible i bought a 2007 cobalt from these rip off artists and it had 80k miles on it so it should have last more than four years the car died this week and i had nothing but problems with it from the time i drove it off the lot,0
the service is horrible food is good but they need to be trained and get some management in there that will train the waiting staff what people expect when they dine out,1
ive now eaten here 3 times 2 out of the 3 our order was taken correctly the kitchen made the wrong order the last time they even made the reorder wrong food is decent and priced fairly you wont be blown away by anything,1
beer and apps were okay but if you are looking for any sort of craft brewing atmosphere this is not it service was below average yet the place was slow i like sleepy dog in tempe but will never return to this location maybe its an attempt to appeal to everyone but it just doesnt work here,1
train wreck  a handful of staff  seated at a booth with their tablets  the f bomb flew out several times  get an office  booths are for customers  flavorless burger well done  no theme except dogs  some irish food reggae music  we wont return,0
love that this place opened up near me if your looking for middle eastern groceries this is a good spotthe fresh flat bread is a must at my house now,4
this is the worst restaurants ever i ordered delivery 2 hours ago and it is still not here i have been to the restaurant couple time and it is so ghetto as hell i will never and wont recommend to go there anymorenni am a chinese i would not recommend going there for sure,0
so happy to see familiar faces after way sushi closed the sushi is fresh and the specialty roll menu original and delicious the surf and turf is the best will be our new go to,4
a bunch of us went for happy hour got a bbq burger pizza boneless wings cheese sticks long islands and margharitas drinks were poor at best wings were ok sticks were good burger was ok but the onion rings on the burger were horrible the service was fine not somewhere i would frequent,1
new instructor meg is also amazing this place keeps getting better and better,4
love this place but whats crazy is that i dont love it for sushi i love it for the burger honestly i wouldnt of tried it but everyone got it so i did too best burger next to my dads burger which is crazy the place is nice i love the seating and the customer service want a burger come here,4
one step above grocery sushi nothing about this restaurant makes it stand out nothing authentic wont last much longer,0
i love this place because of a few reasons they have pretty good sushi for the boxed ones and they can make me rolls without avocado with no complaints because im allergic the service is quick and friendly its a fast way to grab something to eat when youre on the go,4
very disappointing chicken quesadilla was shredded and loaded with so much queso that it was soggy surprised because they have such a good rep but im going to stick with cabo fish taco,0
delish my husband and i love going here for our date nights we both love mexican food and there premium margaritas which come in a fishbowl size glass are great i always get the enchiladas verdes yum the food is fresh the salsas are fresh great authentic flavors,4
love the personal training sessions classes and the friendly ambiance best way to get fit instead of a regular gym always leave here sweating and stronger,4
dirty   nnand dark  they run hand in hand nnnseriously  great concept and all but bring your own lysol purel and vacuum if possible nnservice was pretty quick,2
best mexican food i have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada  sooooo good  salsa was fresh and tasty  everything was hot and tasty  we have now found our favorite mexican restaurant  plus the owner was fantastic,4
unfortunately as of 09182013 this place is now closed,2
actually it seems to be on the last sunday of every month nowyoull need to check their website for dates httpwwwchaiyacmmorgnits well worth it to find this event every time we go there are a few different things,4
this place is amazing the food id delicious and the atmosphere is just fun they have salsa nights on saturdays and the music is great definitely top 5,4
dont bother,1
nice change in dining  fresh and tasty great staff the servings are huge,3
the gelato just wasnt gelato  the taste was fine but the texture was lacking,1
i am very happy madison finally has an antique oddities shop i was pleasantly surprised by finding true medical antiquities and and just strange fun decor the prices are quite reasonable and the store is displayed well i will definitely be going back,3
the food is pretty great diner food  however the last time i was here the waitress whistled along to the song pumped up kicks  i now hope it gets struck by a meteorite,3
be sure to review your dog sitter before you book with them do not trust the reviews  this website had great reviews for green acres dog boarding in gilbert az and they just killed 17 dogs,0
if ur in the mood to relax a little more then the crazyness at rehab then this is a great spot locals welcome also a plus,3
overall we got a great deal here  modern hotel and nice room,2
it was one of those times when you walk in look around then walk right on back out,0
not really on the strip thats too bad because its pretty nicenni would say its less classyluxurious but very urban rocker like my friend told me about this great steak and eggs cafe they have for only 777 gotta check it out next time,2
best beds ever the room may have been a little small for my liking but i could curl up and die with one of the pillows or blankets bartenders know what theyre doing but seem a little rushed some of the time and some of the prices are a wee bit steepnalways can find a good time somewhere in hrh,3
this place is off the hook from when you walk in  rock music blasting  dancers are beautiful the circle bar is fantastic  the drinks are expensive but that is vegas  just gamble and tip the cocktail waitress  see a show here any show,3
checkincheckout was a breeze and my room was super clean and the ac worked      i couldve spent hours which i did walking around downstairs with all the rock memorabilia  love this place and will stay here again,4
the checkin person was great but besides that this hotel sucked no ventilation as the smoke just hit you every time you left the room then they nicked every cent they could from you for items that are usually free in most places not recommended,1
nothing special not nearly as nice as hard rock hollywoodfort lauderdale good casino to lose at machines nobody seemed to be winning def not me its more like a long hallway than an open casino not impressed,0
great service and beer could have done without the girl pushing a survey will return when in town,4
love this bar the owner is fabulous and the girls are super attentive during a big fight the owner reserved us a booth to watch our college game they even let me borrow a phone charger,4
nope went for dinner tonight the place was dirty the sushi was very poor quality and now my husband has food poisoning the sushi was on par with what you buy from a grocery store oh and there was a hair on our menu gross go to yens,0
lasted a month and even with the menu redo its officially closed again this location has so much potential if they could find the right management and remember that its not the strip so resort prices need not apply,0
always delicious as a chinese person and just moving to pittsburgh this place is a gem  well worth the 25min drive on a weekday,4
went for lunch and the service was not impressive considering we were the only two people in the place they do serve boars head meats so the sandwiches we ordered were deliciousnnit looks like they do a brisk business on pastries and cakes they look delicious but didnt try any this trip,2
food was good the service was disappointing your better off going to gallo where people actually care,1
love this placebeen for brunch and dinner several times since it opened highly recommend the pancakes and bacon the street tacos the chicken mole and paella  the otro salad is excellent as are the mojitos,3
their spicy bloody mary is simply amazing my fiancu00e9 got the prickly pear margarita and that was good too nntheir house made guacamole and chips was really tastey nnservice was ok fair prices,3
beau cafu00e9 bien amu00e9nagu00e9 bons produits cependant il est souvent bondu00e9 de plus leur wifi fonctionne tru00e8s mal depuis longtemps et malgru00e9 les plaintes il font rien pour remu00e9dier u00e0 la situation,2
we have found our new breakfast place love the costa rica coffee great pancakes and great service get the maple syrup you can watch them squeeze your orange juice for you,4
good food also had the sexiest server not sure if she is asian or mexican but love the fake eyelashes and tight shirt,3
my dad took me here for breakfast today and it was amazing i had the huevos rancheros which was delish everyone i was with really enjoyed their foodgreat portion and prices,4
great menu awesome food place was packed and had a wait for good reason i there is pretty much every thing you can imagine on the breakfast menu and all the dishes that came to our table were great and the portions huge you could easily split,4
super friendly servers  fast service  had over easy eggs with sausage food was cooked well and the sausage was home made and not out of a package  also tried the homemade hash which was also very good   the reason for five star is the combo of super friendly people and homemade style breakfast,4
great food solid chips salsa bean dip drinks the entrees were good if you like your flautas super crispy like my partner just ask theyll cook em a bit longer locally owned and operated and some of the best service i have had in a mexican in vegas,3
this place is awesome soon ask we enter the door we were greeted and sat right away we sat down and immediately was serve chips and salsa delicious and fajitas were the best i ever had seriously will be back,4
truly is one of the best lounges i have experienced  the new sfo lounge has nothing on this one  the dfw lounge is quite good too  keep up the great work  please keep the brownies,4
when is sbx going to have a line for those of us wanting coffee and not the calorie ladden fraps that everyone likes to call coffee express service now,2
nice staff but not worth the money pastrami sandwich was a joke as a whole  the restaurant has potential but i dont think ill go back any time soon,1
fantastic tacos i tried the carne asada and the carnitas great flavor and juicy the salsa doesnt have a lot of flavor and reminded me of tomato juice,3
this is exactly what vegas started out as  its what its supposed to be about a great live jazz band beautiful women that are great dancers and a wonderful singer i would recommend this show to anyone looking for something to see in vegas,4
i am not a beer drinker but went there last night with husband and friend hubby and friend liked the beer hubby had the james brown brew food not so good i had the fish and chips i would not recommend but service was fantastic,1
bel endroit dans homa pour aller boire un verre et manger un burger le resto est sympa avec une belle du00e9co un service rapide et souriant jai optu00e9 pour un burger vu00e9gu00e9tarien que jai trouvu00e9 bon u00e0 un prix tru00e8s raisonnable  nresto tru00e8s convivial que je recommande,3
ok when i want cheap candy and want lots i come here for 1  i get 2 chocolate bars or huge selection of gummy candies nnthe only ick i have here is the cashiers are slow and like to chit chat and dont give back the correct change,2
this place is terrible  the help is rude  i have been here three times and walked out the last time after the bartender stood around and talked to his buddies instead of serving my date and i  i know it is new maybe it will get better,0
had a great time with coworkers at hi fi on a thursday night great cocktails and good dancing also i must rave about the staff  customer service  asst gm michael m is fabulous he went out of his way to take care of us thanks michael cant wait to go back,4
it looks cool in the reviews but the over look is very cafeie the drink are nice but unless its happy hour they are over priced for a mimosas and some wines the food is worth it not bad considering the area caters to tourist and the ogden residents,1
ive only been here a few times but i have never been disappointed excellent customer service and always amazing food if you love yourself order the acai berry smoothie and the smoked turkey  avocado sandwich best items on the menu as far as im concerned,4
oh you wanted that to go no i wanted to eat here but that was forty minutes ago when i ordered it now i have to go back to work before im late no its cool i can wait another five minutes for you to box it up update i ordered a burger got a chicken sandwich fail,0
they have quick reliable delivery never had a mistake with my order the bbq chips are amazing nnof the sandwiches ive tried they are pretty standard nothing to special but when you are too lazy to drive and have no food at home you can count of jimmy johns to bring you some food,3
spend time there several times even bought some groupons but lately the wait staff is not very attentive you have to ask for refills and no name introduction or real eye contact drinks are goodchris the bartender is the exception as he actually talks to you and makes great drinks,1
great pizza kids love it,4
this place has the right attitude as far as catering to the customer it seems like every time i order from here and pick it up they go above and beyond to satisfy my needs to make the pizza just how i want it i can only hope this place does well because you continue to always go to great measures,3
saw calvin harris at hakkasan on may 4th  i was expecting a lot and i was not disappointed  lots of stairs and no free tap water wtf but overall it was an amazing night  would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an edm club scene,4
horrible over crowded was like a laser tag cavern hot loud and lame went to tao the night before and had a blast also heard xs and marque are good too,0
hakkasan at the mgm is by far my favorite club in vegas it has an awesome set up great sound system and lights with the led background will have you tripping out if you know what i mean so if your in the 702 go to hakkasan joshieapproved joshiethoughts thatsright senorvegasdoesntlie justsayin,4
nightclub was nice but charging me 9 for a specially made extra small figi bottle of water is ridiculous way to go people just have your customers throw up everywhere instead of handing em cups of watertotal turnoff,2
overrated no where to stand and decor was lacking my friends and i were truly disappointed do yourself a favor regardless of the talent hit light marquee xs taoany place but here,1
ok so the music was great had fun dancing the whole night but unless you plan on getting bottle service then you wont be able to see the stage drinks are very expensive,1
i had lots of fun at this club even though i chose not to experience bottle service or any vip extravaganzas my brother and friends were able to get in fairly quickly and it was not grossly overcrowded i would go back,3
the constant electronictechno music made me want to shoot myself there was absolutely no rb or hiphop played the music didnt change all night,0
vip means you have to stand in line for 2 hours i should know better but dont trust a promoter especially shawn,0
the club was interesting but very cramped  packed full of people it was hard to get a drink dance or go to the bathroom  there was nearly no way to get to some open space to have a minute to breathe  it is very similar to other nightclubs on the strip  nothing particularly special about it,1
horrible atmosphere way too crowded the security were incredibly rude and pushy i felt like i was in a mosh pit instead of a club if youre in vegas there are several better places to go dont waste a night at this place,0
wow the seats are amazing  they are very comfortable and i am 66 tall and i do not have to move when i have my legs up people can still walk bynngreat selection of beer on draft toonnway cool place to see a movie  its a cross between a movie theater and my impression of a movie rooms on mtv cribs,4
cant wait to go here again all movie theaters should be like this it is so comfortable you forget you are at a theater and you can order alcohol i will definitely be going here for all my movie experiences from now on,4
only theater in town id go to  comfortable seats and easy parking  always reserve your seats online before going makes things alot easier,4
price is just a 1 or 2 more than the regular cinemas but its super worth it just make sure you buy the tickets and reserve your seats online cause they are limited,4
great selection friendly and knowledgeable staff  one of the most reliable vape stores in the valley with multiple locations,4
went to try it today at lunch and it wasnt open  went to carlys bistro instead fantastic  called the number for scratch when i got back to the office and it was disconnected  guess its closed,0
great food and good pricing the sushi is great and ive never gotten fishy or old sushi here great for kids just wish they had the childrens chopsticks available good atmosphere and outside dining with lake view available,4
went last night based on favorable reviews ordered the special tuna tartar and got a tuna salad then specifically said do not bring the tartar guess what brought that as well truly a language barrier the rolls did not tasted right and my tuna sashimi was dry and fell apart as i picked it up,1
they always have tasty food great stop before a long travel day the brownies and cookies i love this amex perk,4
clearly a one is generous a clear statement by amex regarding the complete ignorance to running a lounge and incompetence of design horrible food uncomfortable furniture no service what the current managers do not understand about travel is shockingly clear  everything,0
food wasnt that great i went there alone still they charged me 18 gratuity and about 30 tip thats 50 in addition to the bill i ended up paying 30 for my lunch,0
love the dinner style decor different from back home and the rest here  food is great,4

food was really good view of market street from second floor was nice however slow service 10 minutes waiting for the coffee to be made,2
i cant begin to explain the horrible treatment  received here  office staff and doctors not trained to treat women with a history of sexual abuse and apparently without a bit of common sense  i miss dr brandon  she was the only good one here but has unfortunately retired,0

inferior meats used on sandwitches looked like they buy meats fromthe dollar storeused to be a lot bettercheap lousy meats waste of money go elsewhere,0
go to the barrelhouse  ive been there a few times and they always have great food and service its in a very random strip mall but perhaps that helps to keep the prices reasonable great drinks dont hesitate,4
the food  was great  too bad the service was terrible  i would go back but would make sure i did not get the same server  it would have earned them a 4 star  it was not just that the kitchen was backed up she was not even friendly or checked on us,2
to be honest this is the second time we came here n for a sushi restaurantlocal food joint its subpar the prices  are a bit high with the not so great food this is the second time here so its not like we didnt give it a chance,0
great for lunch  the sushi is fresh and on point  the service was good and its a pretty good atmosphere,3
had a reservation yet had to wait 30 min for our table then once sat 45 min for drinks food came out before drinks small plates but the menu did not state that was expecting full portion,1

everything on this menu is awesome the cucumber salad i highly recommend,3
not bad at all  i had a cheesesteak daughter had a dog   the  only negative would be that the meals are entree and fries drink is separate  looking forward to trying breakfast menu as well as other items,2
i ate here with my sister and i had the philly deluxe and onion rings onion rings were pretty good the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didnt have much flavor the service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasnt great to me,1
this place seems to be cursed no restaurants ever make it here longterm however the ambiance is very pleasant with rustic yet modern decor throughout the food was above average but not great with few italian options in the old town area i would return here again,3
i really enjoyed this restaurant for a friends birthday celebration  the best part was the cheap fireball shots with the checkin deal  also the food was very good  but whiskey is my weakness,3
cute restaurant food is delicious though not amazing great for a quick bite southern italian cooking dessert menu very small they do feature an item from the nfl chefs  taste of the nfl hunger challenge which is really cool atmosphere okay plenty of parking,2
good place for a quick lunch sandwiches soups and salads  fast service although everything is prepared to order  prices are very reasonable,2
old school friendly atmosphere and great specials  the steak abd lobster comes with veggies and a big ass baked potato,3

i have never really had filipino food unless jolibee counts so i still dont know the names of the food but oh man it was really delicious the service was also really cool felt welcomed and it wasnt busy,3
the place had a lot of potential but they lack the right customer service and the hostesses almost create an uncomfortable atmosphere food is good drinks are good service is absolutely terrible,0
went back for happy hour highly recommended  you can try several different items to eat get full and not break the bank  also a quality selection of beers and good amount of outdoor seating with misters if its not 120 degrees out  ill definitely be back,3
lots of good markets in madison but monona is good choice if you want to get in and out quickly  small relative to other markets but theyve also got some a vendors including java cat gelato and cafu00e9 social brewed coffee and beans,3
wonderful place to stay staff was friendly and helpful food good loved the decor our room was cozy and quiet with free internet newspaper and coffee bathroom was lovely and large had huge windows w with great view of vegas seemed like a real  boutique hotel,4
the best value downtown hands down friendly helpful staff clean as a whistle close to a lot if great places to eat my only complaint was that there was no soapshampoo holder in the shower i will definitely go back,3

the fish taco salad tasted ok but with a fountain drink my bill came to 1510 and i was still hungry,1
had a couple of their famous fish tacos very pricey for the food you get the tacos were mostly cabbage they even used the core of the cabbage which was bitter on the good side their fish was very tasty just not enough for the price tortilla fish has them beat no contest,1

this is a great small restaurant great service and food was delicious try the full taco and it was amazing,4
i have enjoyed many sandwich shoppes   across arizona over my 25 years hear but this is one of the best the freshness of the turkey and the vegetables on top of daily fresh baked bread is incredible,4

pretty good gyros not the best ive ever had but you wont be disappointed just a bit pricey  probably because of lack of traffic they have to make up for it,2

cute place awesome coffee and tea drinks  made by a true barista guy but i cant remember his name and a decent menu all day in addition they have a small but thoughtful beer and wine list ngood location on 7th ave ntriple bonus points because all profits go to supporting catholic charities,4
this review is strictly for the loungebar area  i loved the ambiance and decor here with the balcony overlooking the casino and the changing color lights  super soft leather seating and of course pricy ass drinks  but boogey enough that i was impressed since this was indeed vegas,3

good group of guys work there overall real friendly which is rare for the bar scene limited drinks on tap but prices are very reasonable good food no complaints really the layout is a little odd but that does not bother me,3

we went for an event the other night and wow best food in town seriously they serve 4 dif salads all fabulous 4 did piazzas to die for  4 dif pastas all fantastic my fav was angle hair pasta with tomatoe sauce im going back soon yall should go today,4
omg this place is so amazing the food is so delicious and the price for the portion and the quality is totally worth it the staff are very friendly i m so happy we finally have a great tonkatsu place like this in vegas,4
the food here is great the miso soup is bomb and they have great sides also check this place out,4
theyre menu is constantly changing and theyre adding more items  which is great when they first opened there wasnt many choices  great place for japanese curry but i wish they had unlimited japanese pickled items their katsu curry is awesome,2
the food was delicious like always but the service was terrible by chubby waitress who wears glasses everything else was great,2
ordered steak and blue saladdefinitely not impressed and dont recommend  tasteless with ground up steak bits barely recognizable as meat,1
second time coming here this weekdelicious i love the topping selection how quick they cook your pizzas i have a short lunch break and how everything is a set price regardless of how many toppings you pile on yum,4
surprisingly good  the charburger was tasty their fries are above average and the price is very fair,2
i have always enjoyed being here i have had great meals  friendly staff,3
nice place but was not terribly impressed  our waiter recommended the short ribs which were pretty good although would not put that as the first impression piece,2
definitely 5 star food and service a little different than your typical mexican restaurant but you should try it awesome food and friendly people,4
we have eaten here twice and the food was delicious every time you can tell that it is not your typical fast food chain which is very much appreciated i rather wait a few minutes for a nice meal than having something served thats blend and half way done we will be back for sure,3
some of the worst food ive been served in recent memory  the burrito i had was greasy and completely tasteless  i couldnt eat itnnill never go back  i only wish i could give this place zero stars,0
i bring all my nice clothes that never get worn which ive bought within a year  they always give me a huge chunk of change im very happy this is the only placed i have spent money on clothes in years i always find exactly what i want  come home with amazing clothes even in my shoe size,4
the beer was ok nothing special i think it has a good atmosphere but really only seemed to focus on sweeter beers nngranted they were out of the blonde and anything else lighter we will try them again another time and rejudge,2
the meatballs are amazing the entrees are great interesting delicious cocktails nice atmosphere the service was good and the staff friendly its a great place for a date night or just a satisfying delicious dinner,4
my back yard nice close scenic hiking trails for all of the family to enjoy not many people on the trails theyre well maintained,4
coffee good as usual but incredibly long lines and slow service  almost seemed like there was something wring with their pos system  staff seemed frustrated too and werent too friendly  plenty of other starbucks nearby avoid this one,0
i live 1 hour away from this place i gladly drive 1 hour for an 8 thread because it is so worth it reeta does it perfect   ni have never gotten a better brow job than here,4
arguing with a fool only proves there are two a crazy lady will self destructtrying to control everyone and everything however just another duck,0
maybe i am growing out of my kid phase but i thought the hot dog on a stick was gross and soggy but i will say the lemonade is delicious drive thru was fast and they were nice soso nothing to brag about,2
ate here with a group  while everyone else had steaks i had the chicken  it was very tasty and my friends enjoyed their steaks  i thought it was an odd choice to pair steaks with potato chips lol  we ate here in december so they may have changed that,3
fantastic service  the entire staff makes you feel special and happy to be there  the steaks are great  cooked exactly to order and the best cuts and quality of meat  a far better value than going to the strip  we will definitely going back,4
prices are steep macaroons are nyc prices except in nyc they are twice the size these are samplers size overall they taste okay not special by any means one of those places where you might want to try cause it is there but probably wont miss it if you dont go back,1
service is pretty bad and eclair or croissant were not good at all very much overrated we had to ask for silverware and water twice it wasnt very crowded either nothing we had was close to average including the brunch plank only above average item was the french toast,0
all of their food are good and healthyexcept for the shrimp i love this placerecommended for everyone to try them out,4
seriously i have two jimmy johns the same distance from me and neither will deliver to me thats just a pathetic excuse to be lazy,0
although the representatives are relatively friendly the company is very unprofessional charges higher than standard storage rates refuses to state formal policies and procedures and behaves more like a seedy pawn shop than a legitimate business,0
first time daisho sushi i love this place nngood food and good price nni will be buck,4
re writing my review the owner handled the situation with professionalism and handled the situation with etiquette not displayed at other businessni will definitely give it another shot,3
the boba here is decent depends on what you get the food is horrible dont bother with the food menu,1
thus place is very clean good seating and very friendly and efficient staff have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran definitely will go back again,3
im not crazy about the food here but theres a great huge patio and i would go for a cocktail or glass of wine anytime,2
we are in from texas and happened upon whereubean and were pleasantly surprised great little coffee shop clean comfy and nice staff the coffee is very good according to my very picky friend and their new chai tea is delicious if were ever in phoenix again we will definitely visit again,4
i would have thought they would have better service considering the overabundance of staff kind of an iffy location not easy in  out access parking behind store only,2
im not usually one to leave negative reviews and usually give the benefit of the doubt when i have one bad experience but our family came here and finally left after waiting forever and never getting served too bad because i love places like this and have heard great things,0
quality great service fast and creative i liked the purple rice and generous portions spicy cucumber salad was fantastic and not too crowded,4
fresh margaritas made to order not too sweet best ive had this side of the caribbean tacos are money as well fish and shrimp were my favorite 4 stars because steak tacos were over cooked and guacamole needs more flavor,3
247 weekdays  long hours on the weekend plus if your with a black card member its free this place leaves little margin for excuses not to getkeep healthy its a full blown no brainer  if your not getting busy livein  your getting busy diein,3
the people here are super friendly and nice yhe reason i gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin  i think if they remixed a few  flavors it would be a little better and the second reason is that their liquid is pricey like 21 bucks for one bottle,2

had the italian stallion and it was great  i liked this place better than bianco in terms of pizza  the salad was a bit bland though  i would definitely recommend checking this place out,3
today is my 3rd time in 2 weeks this place id awesome one of the best pizza if not the best in phoenix,3
after reading the reviews i will not give this place a try hair in food thats the worst it ruins the whole experience,0
this drive thru line is beyond insanely slow if i could get out of line i would im held hostage ive listened to 4 songs in my cd already and im only third in line not worth the time wasted,1
both fortunately and unfortunately this location makes a great and consistent coffee however time is money and these folks are chatty and sloooownni sat in the drive thru last week after ordering one vento coffee  for 17 minutes there were only 2 cars in front of me seriously,1
ive eaten here 5 times and the service has been friendly and prompt  food is consistently good at breakfast   this is my first lunch meal  also good but i think breakfast is better   hence the name  strongly recommended,4
have been going back and i love this place more ppl should come out have had the pastrami burger avocado burger and bacon cheeseburger all very good and their wait time at the drive thru has shortened considerably make the drive or stop by way better than inandout,4

love this place very friendly and did a great job on my nails i came here with my mother and wife and we were all taken care of very wellneven though i was suckered in to coming here the owners were funny and made it easy to relax,4
3 stars fast service decent pizza but prefer a hand tossed dough not my cup of tea pizza wise but for those that like a crispy pizza its right up your alley with customization up to 7 ingredients decently priced meal with drink less than 1100,2
these guys have the best churros in townnnthey are amazing and the staff is very friendlynngood price too 12 filled churros for 1650 you cant go wrong with thatnnthey also have more latin food like many different empanadas like beef spicy beef corn tuna and many many more,4
great businessnlike another customer i read on here i was frustrated at someone shattering my window  thankfully nothing was stolen and i called here for service  they came to my house fixed it well and for a great price  ni would and will be recommending them  thanks ash for your great business,4
the food is just fine i had bibimbap but the service is horrible horrible i was shock by how terrible their service was and also they impose 18 of gratuity on the bill which doesnt make sense at all the environment just makes me not want to go again,1
super super slow expect a 15 minute wait in the drive through and about 50 if the time the food is cold or old,0
ive given this location a try twice they screwed up both orders once giving us a happy meal with an empty box where the nuggets should have beennnskip it,0
papa murphys pizza is worth the price and effort to pick it up kids love the double cheese pizza the staff  in chandler are always helpful  friendly,3
nice people and good service its just the food was subpar  if you love airplane food youll love this place  if you like good subs this is probably not the best place for you  another negative is the pricing  it seems to be way higher than subway which has better subs than blimpie,1
eric knows his stuff when it comes to online marketing his systems and processes are set up to get results and i think he is a good guy that cares two thumbs up,4
the server recommendations are amazing and the hospitality is incomparable the yellowtail is definitely a must try the ambience is well polished with a clean atmosphere appropriate music levels and unrivaled presentation,4
really fresh hamachi uni and red snapper sashimi and other raw creations by chef john  matcha tiramisu really hit the spot after some great sushi  definitely will come back to try their happy hour and lunch menu,3

their pizza rolls are to die for we get delivery from here once a week the only downside is delivery usually takes 45mins at least i suppose its worth the wait,3
originally i was quite fond of this place but i recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid when i mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him his response was yeah i know its bad nwont be going back,0
visited this place from a groupon ad as a visitor from dallas coming from a city that is saturated in texmex this by far is the most amazing mexican food i have ever had must visit each time i come to town,4
the food is awesome but the service here is great i asked about options for my girlfriend since she cant have bread and they not only prepared a lettuce wrap but offered to sanitize the counter since bread was prepared on it it wasnt necessary but it was great for him to offer,4
josh is simply the best practitioner in vegas  if you need a tuneup or a serious adjustment josh has the skills and gameplan to restore you to health  he takes a holistic approach to your good health  so glad to find in vegas,4
decent food but chicken has no flavor drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game,1
stopped by this place after work for a couple strong margaritas and an appetizer feels just like the supermex that was there a couple months ago drinks were good appetizer was good and the bartender was very friendly,3
food was good  very reasonable but the real treat is katie who epitomizes what it means to be a great tender of the bar  super friendly very attentive and very easy on the eyes  i sat at the bar and watched monday night football and enjoyed everything,4

poor service overpriced and mediocre food at best they were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish people come here for the name but leave thinking buddy v should stick to cake instead of restaurants,0
very disappointingnn lasagna and agnolotti were tastelessn unpleasantly awkward waiter and bus boyn gorgonzola that came with the meat  cheese plate was amazingnnid put this restaurant on par with an olive garden with so many other tasty places so close by i wouldnt waste my time with buddy vs,1
great service great cars great tracks a must do for kids 10 and over when visiting right off the las vegas strip,4
i was a fan of this place before they moved but the new location is very tiny and theyve done away with a lot of the tasty sugar free treats i used to love now theres only a tiny section of premade and packaged sf sweets i went in a couple of days ago and left nothing very appealing a huge bummer,1
super slow hostess with empty tables probably not a good idea for lunch or parties more than 4,0
food is good service is not so good if youre already in the area its a good option but i wouldnt go out of my way,2
so good the kfc was great especially the mash browns  ive been talking about them since i left possibly my favorite meal i had the whole time i was in vegas,4

super friendly and attentive staff the turkey in the sub i purchased was fine but the rest of the ingredients were lowquality bland central and very little selection nnwouldnt go back sorry,1
this is a meatball joint they sell beer and drinks it is not fine dining i think they do a great job and they arent trying to be anything they arent i dig this place and i eat here frequently i do not give out very many 5 star ratings 4 stars is a really good score for me,3
if you want to be ignored listen to your bartenders complain about their lives enjoy a marginal selection of draft beers and have that true crap southside experience this is the place to be,1
nice atmosphere the breakfast is good the staff seems friendly enough  the macaroons are disappointingalthough tasty they are a little soggier than i would prefer the union at biltmore has far better macaroons than these and 23 times the variety,2
great little australian themed cafe on stlaurent the two guys running it are friendly and more than happy to have a chat they bake their own muffins and the jaffles were a nice reminder of home most importantly the few times ive been in the coffee has not disappointed  well made espresso and lattes,3
they charged me 150 for 60 worth of transmission fluid they must not realize how easy it is to look up the parts in their invoices i can understand a business marking up parts but almost 3x markup is just greedy,0

mike their broker has no personality and is rude on the phone he is impolite to his costumer and will drop the phone on you avoid dealing with people like him and move on to the next business that cares about costumer service,0

igreat food fresh good service clean ample parking we ordered the warm springs roll salmon taco sushi and sashimi and the rock and roll everything was good and the low price made it even better,4
so glad to have an authentic coffee shop walking distance from our office great open floor plan with a killer atmosphere this will definitely be my friends and my new favorite place to head to for a coffee break welcome to the neighborhood sip,3
love this place the staff is always friendly and they have great  beers on tap cant ask for much more they serve cartel coffee and beer btw we had the bruschetta but would loved to try more food just had dinner afterwards planned definitely stop by this place,4
i ate here on last weekend and thought the burgers were really good although a friend and myself became deathly ill that night if you ever had food poisoning it is not fun i know for a fact it was from there,0
love it wine games fun beers pretty good sweet treats are all good but the service thats where its at dumb example greg once gave us a cookie for moving down a seat to make room im stupid for remembering that yes but thats the way to present your business if you want to keep people coming back,4
ive been here twice now and the first time was great service and the mac  cheese was delicious however today was ridic i called at 554 to see if they had hh and i was told yes until 7 we arrived 10 min later and then i was told no we dont have hh today this is why im giving this place 2 stars,1
horrible bland food horrible service but a sweet girl tvs were waaaay too loud only 30 people in the huge place the loud volume was not necessary table was dirty well never go back,0
had the sausage skillet was good but the toast came later and was butterd on one side,1
i had a wonderful experience with my first class here i love the decor and the instructor was extremely helpful and friendly the prices are comparable to other yoga studios but they do offer some specials i cannot wait for my next yoga class,4
kind of on the expensive side but hey what bar isnt right staff of very good looking people hung out here for about a half hour or so great atmosphere,3
the deep dish pizza is good  i prefer oreganos sauce which is spicier but this sauce is probably more authentic  the specialty pizza options were interesting  i got takeout so could not comment on the service  overall i would not hesitate to return if i was in the area,3
best pizza in arizona arizona had been waiting for this for a long time  we were customers in il and the owners have kept up the exact same quality and service  we didnt want to move back to il to have great pizza  thank you buzzyz for always delivering a superior product,4

it was ok  i was hoping for better service and few more choices on the menu,2
really great deal  coffee was a little weak but dads 395 two eggs with hash browns was such a great deal  my korean omelette kalbi onion and cheese was flavorful but will probably not try that combo again  fun chatty owner and chef  brightly colored walls and decor  good morning start,3
great selections of beer from the local micro brewery  i only wish i had more time to eat the menu offers a good selection of better than average airport food decent prices without gouging the travellers much appreciate the fast service knowledgable staff and beer descriptions,3
stopped for breakfast while waiting for my connection in phx food quality was really poor wilted fruit soggy home fried and an undercooked egg would not recommend to a friend,1
customer service was poor and the smoothie i got was so awful i had a horrible taste in my mouth for the longest time,0
great park with nice amenities there are not many large family parks in the this area and this one was worth the wait it has everything you would want in a park and more,3
come hungry leave happy awesome place never seen like this fine sushi restaurant,4
extremely knowledgeable and professional staff  hard to find pieces  excellent service,4
it was horrible to park  there were way to many people  the lines to everything were long  bring cash most vendors dont take credit cards  10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people,0
cool placeburgers are fresh and gooddont taste like a grease bomb like 5 guys  only thing is it is a little spendy for a burgercant beat innout for overall quality and price,3
great quick and friendly service the manager was willing to let me use the check in coupon even after i had paid for my sub which was cool i like the variety of subs that are available and all the ones that ive tried have been pretty good,4
great service no wait actually owned by pamelas the food was great maybe even better than next door all sorts of yiddish references and fun jewish foods that are hard to find elsewhere love the challah french toast highly recommended,4
had the knishwich  matzo ball soup thoroughly enjoyed them both this place is definitely on my pittsburgh brunch list,4
i really like this place a lot better now that theyve moved from the borgata  its a nice open floor plan and i love the outside patio and bar area  my pizza was great and im pleased to see their nice selection of italian wines,3
very limited menu but in a good wayn food quality is not what you would expect at a fast food   restaurant it was very goodn the employees are nice but a little too excited for your average customer they take customer service very serious,3
i like the idea i like the simple menu been there several times the only downside is once in a while the chicken will be rubbery but that just depends on the chicken i guess,3
great chicken fingers bland and boring coleslaw regular old krinkle cut fries come for the chicken fingers and cane sauce skip the rest,2
the service and food is great my wife and i eat here often and highly recommend it for anyone who loves a great sandwich nanother plus is the restaurant is always clean,4
it was a quick easy and inexpensive way to get my smog test  the tech was most friendly  i used to go to the sinclair station by the dmv but it is now a shell with the most rude people  express smog is close to qdoba  see you next year,4
darryl showed up right on time and made the repair in just a few minutes  cleaned up after himself and the price was very fair  i will certainly use darryl again and recommend him to others,4
not at all what was expected the website leads you to believe bit is a gourmet bakery and breakfast place when in reality it is a run of the mill mediocre sandwich shop,1
ctc is awesome i just took my 1st crossfit class and would you know i survived  steve  boris are amazing trainers and i am so happy to work with them it really is like family in there people i have never met in my life were encouraging me to keep going ctc will forever be my gym,4
so much fun entire family participated in roc challenge and loved it,4
i had fun but wouldnt likely do it again everything was cool just not that exciting at 43 years old glad that i did it but wasnt that impressed with the overall experience for the cost the packet pickup line at sports authority was a joke  most people loved it and definitely worth trying once,2
five stars is not enough i had a crack in my windshield and needed it fix asap in just a day they were able to come to my house and fix it at the lowest price jose and luis did a fantastic job in less than an hour thank you guys so much,4
this is actually just to let you know that layalina has reopened a couple of blocks over at 401 s first st the old minnecis location i did not go in but i did see the open sign today saturday feb 8 2014,4
i received a response from william  apparently my first email went into his spam folder  he is going to provide an email gift card for us to try the place out again  i havent received the card yet but i think my husband and i will give it one more shot and see if things have improved,0
ive been seeing tracy over 3 years and ive never left disappointed i let her do her thing with my color and it looks great i have long hair and shes never chopped it off either thats always a fear seeing someone new,4
great fresh food and craft beer selectionnordered the 29 burger one of the best burgers ive ever had and fresh cut fries to go with itnnclosest bar to the kitchener rangers arena  owner liam is very friendly and let us park here for the game nnhighly recommended,4
i gotta give them 5 stars  i love the old house ambiance and the friendly service  my italian pasty was excellent and enough for two meals  they have a great beer selection  be sure to enjoy their patio when the weather is nice,4
great drinks   awesome music and environment   ribs are tough which is unfortunate   but satisfied with experience,3
the food is way too salty and the service was horrible we waited over an hour for our orders i would understand if the place was busy but it wasnt beyond annoyed all we got was soup and burgers they had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch,0
awesome place lauren is the best great service love the drinks most definitely will go for seconds,4
to begin with the sugar factory at town square has a great staff and an amazing experience the only minus is that the food comes from a very select menu and is not all that great also it doesnt even compare to the sugar factory on the strip,2
its all about the staff second disappointment and we didnt even eat there i thought this one would be different but i was wrong no more sugar factory for me,0
horrible service hot chocolate was delivered 10 minutes after the rest of our order and tasted terrible avoid this place,0
this is ridiculous the place is empty and i cant get a table to eat desert i need to order at least appetizersni was honest to say i want i have a desert hosted was unbelievable rude,0
went to this place and it is the bomb i had shrimp and it was delicious  i would definitely recommend this place for everyone,4
this place has amazing burgers the best onion rings and fries in charlotte  if your after a burger check this place out you wont be disappointed,4
fantastic my favorite japanese restaurant in urbanachampaign,4
this place is 5 for adults 2 for kids and everything there is to do costs even more money the website doesnt say any of this im very aggravated that i spent 11 to get me and my kids in here and still cant do anything without paying at least 3 more per kid i feel rather ripped off i wont be back,1
this is just an average cafe we ordered fish and chips fried chicken and a belgian waffle everything was just ok not bad not good i do commend them for serving up fresh fried chicken and not prefried frozen banquet chicken like a lot of other places in vegas the prices are very reasonable,2
not a good place to go worst service waiting times after waiting  one hour and forty five minutes food arrives but no more drinks  to bad this is a new location not planing to go back any time soon,0
review to come soon just got say those cocktails were rather good indeedy,3
stay awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyynyelperasssssssssssnstay awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyynagain and again and again the will try to charge more money,0
this place is amazing and it just opened up by my house so i decided to make an appointment for a new set of lashes the lounge is nice and relaxing olga was the girl who did my lashes and she was wonderful and i loved the end results of my lashes they now have me as a regular client,4
just ok nothing special live around the corner probably wont be back it aint my thang,2
hands down best pho in town also try the beef salad and tom yum soup i have yet to try the sandwiches and rice dishes definitely coming back to support the business i found my new spot,4
staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat i ordered the food to gonngenerous portions tasty,3
big portions good flavor great prompt service great price  pancakes  than ihop waffles better than waffle house french toast better thanmaking it yourself  will be back,4
bloody marys were great food was awesome  dave and roxanne ate great people,4
nice atmosphere semi interesting menu  however 7 for a burger when i can get a better one at elsewhere with bacon for less left me feeling unsatisfied,2
best pho ga and banh mi that i have had in arizona  i discovered this lace on 1017 and had to go back today 1020 both times greeted with warmly and sincerely the baguette was perfection  for the banh mi my new favorite lunch spot,4
food is absolutely not up to par for montreal service is horrible been waiting 25 min already for our bill skip this place,0
food was enjoyable and there was plenty i just hate when restaurants cheapen the quality of the meat the steak used to be actual steak but is now a cheap philly steak type of thing and charging for the sauce that used to be put on the food is a bit much as well,2
it was okay very clean nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing,2
just an amazing concept great breakfast menu and even better brunch menu love the cupcakes and cookies,4
love love love this place the staff is so nice and welcoming but the best part is the variety of unique waffles you must try the maple bacon waffle and the red velvet so yummy and to die for nni cant wait to return and try some of their other items,4
in vegas for a show wanted to investigate vegan options small place nice mellow vibe and the food tastes great coffee is good too cabbie didnt have a clue how to get here but found it easily with my phone nav app worth the trip if you want to venture off the strip to seek vegan eats,3
6325for two pizzas and salad pretty freaking krazy,0
the best pizza in town the only pizza my hubby and i will eat friendly staff and owners,4
this was our best meal in vegas and the cheapest sweet potatoe fries were amazing and we loved all the different ketchups to try the hamburgers were huge and amazing we will be going back,3
the buns i think that was the best part of the burger super soft chewy buns  had the mushroom swiss burger and the western one had onion rings and bacon in it and the sauce selection was bomb digs they even have the nifty coke machine with a bajillion flavors i would totally go back,3
new place but experienced owner amazing blue cheese burger with a side of wing hot sauce also have tried all the specialty drinks and you cant go wrong with any of them,4
this was our first time in the restaurant the food was good and reasonably priced will be back again,4
i love this place my wife and i go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the cardinals game they do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones,4
i was not impressed food quality was low and tasted cheap i have no idea why ppl rave about it i wont go back liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food,0
i had a good stay loved the pool sayers club and bazaar check in was a pain in the ass but with that aside it was good,3
not a big casino like others on the strip what i liked about this place was that it wasnt crowded next time i would like to hit up the stores during business hours,2
questionable,0
small rooms w small beds walls are extremely thin no wonder its cheap you really get what you pay for will never stay here again,0
food wasnt that good gyro had meat that was flat and lacked flavor  seemed over priced too,1
fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor  the falafel was kind of the same  im not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the american folk cuisine,1
worse dairy queen ever so gross i recommend everyone not to eat here always dirty the bathrooms there are just gross all the employees are rude and always on the phone my brother in law got food poisoning here never stepping foot into this place again and recommend you dont either,0
some of the best fried rice in the state seafood hotpot is amazing connoisseur cocktails youve never heard of,4
wownunbelievable amazing without a doubt the best crab i have ever ate you can pick from multiple varieties of seafood then you pick your flavor i always pick trifecta then you pick your level of spice watch out number five will get younwe recommend this to everybody it is amazing amazing amazing,4
if you like joes crab shack  then maybe this is your funky medinannnoisy cramped environment with chinese quality seafood served in a plastic bag that you open and eat directly off the table with your fingers nnya hoonnits just not my  bag,0
i love this place the custard is always cold and delicious i love the smell of freshly cooked waffle cone  i love the atmosphere music the decor on the wall it really takes you back to more wholesome time  so another saturday another custard run,4
easy to enjoy such clean fresh food this restaurant would be a great addition to any city  it is wonderful to have restaurant owners who are responding to our community wanting more organic and healthier choices,3
really wanted to like this place  but had a horrendous experience all around staff was woefully inept and over their heads  food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt  inedible  we will not be back  very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early  good luck to them,0
been here once its small lots of shops live music the praying mantis lights fire around 9pm i personally didnt like it its very much for families i felt awkward so my date and i found other things to do wasnt my thing might try it again one day but not anytime soon,2
not impressed at all  the food didnt have much taste to it and its overpriced for the portion you get,0
really good tacos but overpriced for what it is,2
i am in love with these tacos ive tried every kind they make even the lengua and the food is seriously outstanding a musttry if youre down on fremont near container park,4
finally got here for dinner heard about this restaurant from my friends many times the food quality is good environment is not bad doesnt feel like those typical japanese restaurants i definitely will come back again had a great dinner here love it,3
cool spot in container park small intimate great bartenders extremely friendly great size pours will be back when in the area,4
authentic chinese food good price too we will be back u63a8u8350u76aeu86cbu7626u8089u7ca5u3002u3002the lady was friendly wish we found this place sooner,4
blech  this isnt pizza  the steak hoagie tasted decent but thats not steak either then again this wouldnt be worst decision you could make at 1am,1
absolutely fantastic product the grapefruit is amazing exceptional good service every time ive been there too,4
this year all the markets were labeled edinburghs christmas but some of the old faves were still at the old school end not as many pretty handcrafted things but lots of options for nibbles and plenty of entertainment,2
excellent presentationnnice decor unchanged from painted ponyncalamari appetizer so songood service,2
ive been working out with tony and team 44 for almost 2 years i cant even tell you the difference he and his programs have made on my life i love the small classes the accountability and the support he and his team provides i am forever spoiled by this fantastic fitness concept,4
this spot just doesnt do it for me  flavors fall short  vegetables are over cooked and soggy  nnthe service is fine the location is nice overall the food was mediocre,1
awesome tacos and awesome service stoked on this place,4
the ambiancecircuses are okbut the food is actually fast food hiding in fancy clothingexpensive but mehhh the popovers are no way near as good as those at blt camelback inn  the place is ok but kind of caters to the arcadia types and takes advantage of them expense does not match the value,0
fantastic service great food there was a mix up with the tables for a reservation and the management colin went well above and beyond highly recommended for anybody looking for a quality meal,4
fantastic  only complaint was the late reservation  great ambiance great staff great menu and delicious food  branzino and braised short rib are pretty incredible prices are fair based on quality  possibly a larger wine list by glass definitely going back,4
food was ok service was bad  and atmosphere was good server never checked on us and we waited for awhile to order longer than it should take probably wont come back again,1
reasonable prices for really good food really good pupusas they serve breakfast all day long thats just awesome,3
yoga styles rock  susan has created gorgeous and functional custom products for my acuwellness practicebusinessshe is a creative genuseasy to talk too and always willing to try somethingi love my yoga styles productsand am grateful for susan nichols,4
i cannot really explain how slow the service is we were seated and waited about 10 mins till we went to the bar to get service we then waited another 30 or so for food our drinks were never refilled the whole time  we watched about 5 hostesses sit around and and do nothing not worth 13 for a burgers,0
burger was good fried oysters werent as good overall good lunch,2
favorite burger place so far amazing servicehelpful waiters great beer just loved it,4
average at best and i might be being generous the food was ok service was average  not what i expected,2
horrible please dont waste your time or money i got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling two thumbs down they should change the name to nails you hate,0
awesome vegan nachos   tasty fruit salad mmmmmm im definitely coming back,4
new location lines at the drivethru wrapped around the building but moved fairly quickly  the staff was courteous and efficient  ordered the shrimp poboy which was cold but the onion rings were hot and delish  this is a chicken place so maybe thats what i should have orderednnnot bad for fast food,2
hit and miss some dishes were amazing others were average i would go back tho great service,2
nice  at least i could find a seat   good coffee nice to see their expansion into more locations  beans are good  iced coffee good internet good  music good  people not super loud at this moment  good mix of people han style solo and in groups  parking not a problem  stamp of approval,3
drove all the way here and they are closed for maintenance until end of may i just wish that businesses that are on yelp would make us aware of these types of things bc now i have a bad taste in my mouth,0
espectu00e1culo entretenido las chicas bailan muy bien pero se ve que los guionistas se fumaron algo cuando idearon el guiu00f3nnmickey es el mas divertido de los actores,2

love the whole subway concept for pizza i dont know whats better the pizza or the price,3
food is good service sucks super slow not good for people who work here and have times breaks i wish they would pick up speed 15 mins for french fries is out of control get it together so i can enjoy your food,0
hey i think this place is great the bagels are fresh the salads are fresh and the black and white cookies are out of this world the people are nice and the everything is ready quickly if you want need have to have a great bagel this is the place to go,4
closest ive found to njny bagels in charlotte area bagels are pretty great had a sausage egg and cheese and it was delicious  a little neater fluffy scrambled egg and less greasy than a true brooklyn bagelbut thats really not a complaint and i guess thats the charlotte touch,3
food was pretty good  service was great  will go back again not very wide selection of beer thou,4
green acres killed my 3 dogs and 19 others last week i hope they have shut down yelp please dont delete this truthful post as you have all the others you could be saving a dogs life by keeping this up,0
good beer selection food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly probably wont be going back,1
mellow mushroom is terrible  i have never written a review before but this place is a grotesquely racist establishment and i never want to return to it ever again  i would give it negative 100 stars if i could,0
good place and has a nice potential of becoming a mix for both tourists and locals but the coffee shop doesnt have heavy cream i am on the mission to find at least a couple of coffee shops in downtown that could make a cappuccino with heavy cream,0
ok so went back and ordered the full sandwich and soup  it came with chips also which you do not get when you get suckered into the half soup half sandwich thing  this time i felt like i got what i paid for  much better and will be back,4
the chicken is wonderful its moist and juicy  the burritos were great too  awesome place to have a casual lunch or dinner  the one thing that is confusing is how to order food  they should make that easier to figure out at first blush,3
horrible company that lies to employees and withholds pay without any communication or reason the people who are suppose to support you jump to conclusions nnndont work here unless u want to make 60 of what you earn,0
great brunch  i had a lobster omelette  we were in a rush and they got our orders out very quickly and were extremely nice  will definitely go here again when im in the area,4
i found the show to be extremely entertaining and funny as hell  a great interaction with the crowd and hilarious impersonations   the finale was my favorite   i loved that he met with everyone after the show and thanked them personally for coming out   if youre in vegas go check this show out,4
management at this location needs some work i have been to this location multiple times now as i love chipotle but this location is not run well,1
i went to guss once and havent been back there was loud electronic music playing the whole time so it was really hard to talk i had the sloppy joe which was good but overpriced seeing that no side came with it just a really weird experience,1
i have no idea what is going on here  go somewhere else for you veggievegan needs  this place seemed promising too,1
saw roaches on the floor waitresses were hella rude complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out the chef looks like a fat sweaty slob just a horrible experience customer service is foreign to them,0

you wouldnt think brunch at this place but youd be so wrong great breakfast with inventive dishes including a unique spin on eggs benedict and a great pastrami hash dont miss the bloody mary bar,3
good food but not top of the line love the portion size for the price not crowded especially at lunch and really reliable takeout the queso blanco gets hard quick especially love the saucy fajitas,3
not very friendly on your wallet save you  and skip the burger as a burger aficionado i was disappointed by the burger medium is medium and not well done the meat had very little flavor which is why i assume the mix garlic in with the meat still not impressed,2
great music but bartenders seems to be bothered or you feel unwelcome no smile  just drink,2
this place is probably a love it or hate it  its kind of a cross between zombie and goth  its pretty much a bar with a them and a small place to dance  not my scene but im sure others would like it and for a local watering hole it adds a little variety,1
we really liked this place the owners were friendly the specialty drinks were good and pizza was really out of this world,4
skip the dining room and eat at the bar robert was our bartender and he did a great job hes very knowledgeable about the tequila we did a full on tequila tasting and got a little lesson in each brand his service was top notch the food was good but i think the tequila was my favorite part,2
very nice place   the ladies are very polite and friendly i would recommend  any one go there and get one of the best massages you have every had and only 30 dollars  very good deal,4
the staff could have been friendlier  we were greeted by what do you want  the food was ok  we ate there and everything was in styrofoam   i was expecting some plates  the price wasnt bad i will give it another try,2

cloud 9 is the best hookah spot great djs great staff great crowd over all yeah they might not serve alcohol  but they do have a xbox one that you can play with while smoking the best flavors in town,4

britney piece of crapnnthis was a terrible show  britney was bored and barely moved  i will never get that time back that i wasted at her show  save your money go to a different show or just sit outside at cabo wabo and people watch its much more entertaining,0
its britney bitch and she does put on quite performance  the  theatrics are fantastic and her dancing is still superb  she does lip sync but seriously the actual performance is flawless and the songs are true classics  seating is great although you will spend most of the 90 min on your feet,4
lowlimit casino next to the flamingo and imperial palace as everyone here has said it markets to the younger crowd as the beer pong tables in the back say it all no thanks give me the harder stuff won 20 on roulette and lost it on the slots worth another visit when i return to vegaswhenever that is,2
for simply having beer pong i give osheas 5 stars cheap tables are a plus too,4
if a neighborhood chicago bar had gambling this would be it the lowlimit tables are the only asset i can see go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune,1
this place is awesome we spent most of our time in vegas at osheas they have blackjack tables that play with a single deck and 1000 minnimum which is hard to find the crowd here is laid back and fun and of course the beer pong how can you pass on this place i plan on coming back over and over,4
ive only been here once and that was on a thursday while a 90s rock cover band was playing the band was way beyond fun i honestly would have still enjoyed myself while sober and being able to play beer pong added to the excitement,3
so much for sunday funday the waitresses are more interested in the guys then taking care of you,1
everything i had changed my life spring rolls tom kia penang curry with chicken sticky rice with mango amazing,4

fantastic pizza and you cant beat the lunch special 2 slices and a drink for 5 the slices are huge and full of flavor i took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a goto dinner,4
if you are a duck enthusiast go there and as well fries cooked in duck fat best fries i ever ate,3
love this place no matter when i go they are so sweet thats very hard to find in fast service places,4
i like the fact that they open till 2 am but i dont think i like the food very much tried their dumplings and beef noodle the noodle was a bit undercooked while the dumplings were just ok i like the dumplings at the other place better on the same street no intention to go back,1
probably the most pathetic place i have ever been bouncers think that being a bouncer is really important getting inside is like accomplishing absolutely nothing nothing to see nothing to do guys with big egos and small   go somewhere else,0

so basic so loud so dark so packed ugh and regulars sitting on the bar really like 2 dudes literally sittingg on the bar i dont care who youre bro is im trying to get a drink here take off your too cool metal mulisha tee and let someone else enjoy a song or two  before i get the heck out of here,0
my favorite indian restaurant in madison delicious,4

i have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow i dont have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure plus i hate that they are close on mondays and dont open until 10 this is a 24 hour town open at least at 9 am time to get to a new place,0
incompetent and rude staff in the office they do not even acknowledge maintenance requests within a reasonable amount of time let alone perform the repairs people are breaking rules eg parking noise satellite dishes chairs and garbage out on the landing which makes it unpleasant,0
skoti was awesome he kept his word was very punctual and treated a group of 11 of us like we were vips i would recommend himhis company to anyone going to vegas whos trying to enjoy the real vegas experience definitely calling him on my next trip,4
got a tepid cup of coffee at 700 am that tastes like it was brewed with tea mixed in with it  it doesnt appear these people can even do coffee correctly,0
too expensive casino owned harrahs double the price of a regular corporate owned starbucks,1
best place ever this is really the best place to get a super affordable car wash everyone is so friendly and helpful and my car is as clean as can be i drove away in what felt like a brand new car that smelled like pina colada,4
so delish every doughnut i have had has been absolutely amazing my favorite is the chocolate glaze or the cinnamon cake,4
best donuts in the world  i have not traveled the world but im pretty sure im right  plus they do have free wifi so why go to another place for mediocre donuts  if im gonna eat those kinds of calories i want each one to be delicious,4
this place was amazing impeccable timing out to order to table time with hot fresh is housed the sauces are awesome the ambiance is clean cannot say enough good things amazing specials lunch is only 599 with the drinks which is also just awesome,4
turkey avocado on french country will change your views on what a sandwich is capable ofits that good top it off with raspberry bread pudding and your taste buds will thank you profusely,3
i love the bread pudding and the soup  but the prices are high not open on sunday and i was not impressed with the breakfast,2
this is my first time coming here im not sure if i got something that you should get but the bread or crust was really excellent the service was good as well all in all its different than the average place to eat,4

delicious huge slices for affordable prices the combo is a great deal very friendly service too,4
great service and a cool setup cool employees and friendly  prices are great  great selection of eliquid,4
had lunch last week at the town square location  bartenders were wonderful and made fresh drinks every time  we ordered 6 different meals off the happy hour menu  everything was great especially for the hh price,4
just heard this place closed as of 7312014 why am i not surprised such a disappointment  guess i wont get the chance to give it another chance can we have blue burrito back now please,0
then you guys call me liars great way to handle yourselves professionally i bought 2 drinks and some cheese sticks which i paid for the inexperienced emoloyees are your real problem you offer me a hit of your ice bowl gimmick  then try and make me pay for it what a joke,0
it was ok i expected much more from reviews way to much rice and just didnt do it for meor if was organic would have made a whole lot more of a differencesorry not a winner 4 me and my husband would not eat here and had to watch him eat at ling  louiesthat sucked not feelin this at alll,1
awfulthe pork was so dry no taste veggies were nothing special mostly onion and carrots because they are cheap the sauce thai was bad not even sure what it tasted like very expensive for what i got i will never go back no wonder it was half empty at lunch,0
they get one star for cleanliness and decor aside from that the service was horrible and they were out of half of the items on the menu,0
we are from seattle where we have amazing sushi so were pretty particular  this was hands down probably the best sushi and rolls ive ever had  i will definitely be going back when im in vegas,4
amart has a great selection of different asian foods from korean chinese japanese to vietnamese the prices are pretty fair as well which is great the people who work there were fairly nice as well which is always a plus nni will definitely continue to shop here d,3
the lettuce was brown and the owner tried to convince me it was fresh that was after i came back to tell him that i got sick from eating there never going back we,0
weve been to this place a few times in the past always heartily satisfied with our favorite vietnamese dishes but were still amazed with how theyve expanded their menu  thats probably drawing this large late sunday night crowd lobster with black pepper beckons  as always service was great,4
amazing food everything we got was amazing ill have to write an updated review with a list of everything we got because we tried a bit of everything however what stood out to me the most was the oxtail fried rice yummms,4
i love district one the bartender adrian is amazing she recommended the stir fried pepper lobster with garlic noodles and it was incredible 3 pounds of heaven thank you adrian you made my birthday so special and those coconut mojitos blow my mind,4
wow i must say im very excited about this place   today was the first time trying the deep dish pizza and it was excellent   loaded with cheese pepperoni and extra sauce  yum  we will be back,4
atmosphere is great food is not had the pasta w meatballs which consisted of a bowl of gummy flavorless pasta w 2 small meatballs for 1500 i left hungry and went home and ate a pbj sandwich,1
bartender was quite knowledgable and helped me get a terrific wine nice ambiance  nice relaxing place to chill and have a nice conversation,3
we went here for dinner and the place was closed  we ate at banderas next door  bartender at banders told us the pink pony was closed for goodthe end of an erathanks economy  we will miss you pink pony,4
i had the buffalo chicken pizza delivered and it was great i have also tried the pepperoni and it was ok i feel its a bit overpriced and id recommend only if you have a coupon,3
the service was terrible i could hear the servers in their service station all huddled together cussing loud enough for me to hear not very classy needless to say the food was good but you can get great meals anywhere in this city service is what sets it apart not a fan,0
perfect barbeque super friendly i cant believe this place is for real i feel like i stumbled upon a secret,4
the parking and long wait mentioned by many is worth your time if you love texas style bbq the resemblance to franklin bbq in austin is uncanny in quality and concept only suckers show up at the longest line at 1100am come after the rush at 130pm to wait in a shorter line,3
great location to ride your bike to and enjoy  sunday  unfortunately the positive experience stops there  overwhelmed with the drinking crowd the service was minimal glasses were dirty and the food is not worth the effort,0
well tacos were very good and the sides werejust fair  patio is nice and drinks are fun  not sure if i would go back because there are so many fun places but its fine for a lovely day to sit and enjoy the sun  we had good service and lots of refills of chips and salsa,2
hey i loved the breakfast bowl i got here i think all the breakfast bowls here are really good other than that though the service is just extremely slow,2
the decor and vibe are way classier than the peoria location however the service is a bit lacking its large clean and has indoor and outdoor seating but it definitely is suited for the old town scottsdale crowd their menu is pricier and more upscale than the peoria location as well,1
so not feeling it the drinks were watered down  the food came out cold and one of my tacos fell on the table the waitress didnt even offer to replace it so not worth it never coming again,0
great service very enjoyable atmosphere and amazing food nwe went right at 5 oclock and sat at the hibachi we were very pleased that they allowed us to go ahead and have hibachi even though it was just 2 of us our chef joe was super fun and nice nwill definitely being returning,4
this is not a restaurant that i will ever come back to the food was poorly made not a representation of the images on the menu i spent the early portion of my morning and day attending to a very upset stomach after a few bites,0
i like the pillows in the booths ni dislike the length of time it takes to get a shot of wheatgrassnthe juices and smoothies taste amazing and freshnthe prices are ridiculously high nclean great decor aesthetically pleasingnno patio or outdoor seating,3
this place is the shit especially when you can walk across the street welcome to the neighborhood,4
i want to like this place because it is near the house but the incredibly poor service makes that impossible   with so many people out of work you would think they would be able to hire someone mildly competent,0
they accommodated to me and my friends very generously i ordered teriyaki chicken and he used some of it to make a roll he thought i would like i love the service atmosphere food and especially the staff a must go if youre in vegas or looking for a new sushi place,4
my favorite sushi joint nservice was great and the food is greaternhad all you can eat dollars well spent,4
ive been coming to cosmo nails now since june and i have to say this place is absolutely my new favorite shop and i wouldnt go anywhere else its the best one in nlv everyone does an amazing job as well kudos,4
food was good but it all came out 510min apart actually had to have one dish wrapped up because it never came out the rice was good and so was the hummus will go back but gonna wait a while to see if they get it together,2
rude welcoming by owner store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon what do u need walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesnt understand service,0
authentic urban dining experience stellar fast friendly service and good conversation if you can catch em when theyre not too busy menu changes regularly to showcase their talents but the chicken and the falafel are musttrys dont let the location fool you these guys are talented and professional,4
very solid effort rich decadent pizza  pizza doesnt really look like beautiful pictures on facebook  crust is thinner and toppings do not fill up to the top as pictures of the garlic crust pan pizza seem to suggest  i also expect pizza to be salty but damn this was salty,2
ryan is an amazing personal trainer who will bring everything to you and give you a serious full body work out he helped me plan my meals and prepare for the miss az usa pageant i highly recommend the get fit group to anyone looking to improve their overall health and wellness,4
loved this place they took their time and gave a great massage close to my work and no wait when i walked in this is my new pedicure spot,4
convenient efficient and one spot above fast food but a gimmicky upgrade only and def overpricedwelcome to vegas,2
i was so disappointed  bobby flay should revisit this place  this food did not live up to the hype fries too salty my medium burgernwas more medium well  too pricey for the nlack of quality  go down the block to gordon ramseys,1
to pricey ordered spam masubi and turon bites spam masubi the rice was to hard n i think the spam wasnt cook right n the turon bite wasnt the turon i was expecting  so i give it a 2 for now,1
i wish i could do zero stars i scheduled an appointment and received a confirmation only to wait two hours with no show and also no call back i was extremely disappointed and wish i had read the reviews ahead of time,0
carmen did a great job and was very flexible with times to come in nice to find someone that also does mens haircuts in old town,3
the burgers are perfectly season that you dont need the condiments which is very rare to find they just need to work on service,2
came here during vacation and thought of trying it out the portions are really big and reasonable pricing the food is made from scratch and was delicious definitely recommend this place,4
rio has ruined a great breakfast food is not the same as the original food was cold service is poor go to the free standing spot not in a casino,0
i had a huge burger and it was ok i would have liked a little less quantity and more quality not a place i would return to i ate about 13 my meal and was disappointed the tractor is cool,1
great locations forget the rest its old i will not stay there again,0
bad very bad i had to walk down 16 flights of stairs yesterday with my luggage our toilet didnt work our lights didnt work and we got stuck in handicap room when all i wanted was a bathtub nnwe waiting to complain but the lines were forever long just dont go here avoid at all costs,0
horrible dirty unfriendly valet and front desk people go anywhere else waste of money,0
the worst room was incredibly dirty left over trash from previous guests blood stained boot prints on the couch a tshirt and an ear ring left in the bed on top of all of this it was the worst costumer service ever pictures will be posted,0
i dont understand why caesars palace would allow their name to be associated with this very old and rundown hotel our last night we were locked out of our room what the i would not recommend this hotel to anyone the restaurant in here hash hash a go go is worth checking out but thats about it,0
never again this place is gross dirty stained sheets windows that dont open bathrooms with no locks nnstayed here for 4 days housekeeping never once came why dont you care nnnoh they give aaa discounts but you need to tell them before you book,0
the worst customer service experience unfortunately for them my expectations for customer service are a bit higher seeing that this is a higher end vegas spotbut damn just really upsetting,0
this place is amazing whether you do the lunch buffet or order by plate youll love what you get no matter what though you must try the mango with sticky rice its perfect,4
stay away the food from the buffet is not worth ten dollarsi wouldnt eat it if it was freeas i write this i have a stomach ache after one medium size plate of food,0
if there were an option for no stars i would give it no stars the first time around they brought out the wrong order and had to wait another 15 mins had to ask server to refill our drinks nni would not recommend this place and would defiantly would not come back,0
just had the worst experience at this place the staff is rude there was 20 open tables 4 party sitting horrible service do not go,0
very slowand theres not very many people   didnt bring food for two people   when we asked why they said the cooked accidentally closed our order   no real apologies  food ok but not worth the lack of service,0
i loved the environment and the staff was incredible  nnthe food wasnt amazing just  goodnand the cost didnt justify what was on my plate,2
great service very attentive my wife and i interviewed numerous djs before we met and immediately hired dj shai for our wedding you can trust him to incorporate the musical and themes you want as well as keep the party going,4
friendly and superior customer service brings me back to them time and time again  my packages are always delivered on timei do all of my shipping printing and purchases at cliffs pony express  i highly recommend  a ten plus,4
i had the vege stuffed nann vegetables freshly prepared nann not too dry i had spinach rice as a side very good good cozy place to dine,3
the sushi was surprisingly really good but the rest of the food was mediocre the place was clean and service was decent its no five star buffet but my experience was much nicer than the previous reviewers i would recommend for large parties as there are many options especially for kids,2
dbs is fantastic place with a wonderful atmosphere the food is excellent and is always absolutely perfectnour favorite waitress is maggie shes soo friendly always has a smile remembers you and your kids never have to hunt her down love her,4
their donuts might be amazing but ill never know not only is this place annoying to get to  its inside of a car wash and theres no parking  its never open ive tried twice now because its so close to my house but its been a total waste of time both trips,0
marita and now michelle are my go to hair stylist  they do such an amazing job on coloring my thick crazy hair  nnmy hair never gets damaged and the results are exactly what i want thank you marita and michelle  love your work,4
alex does the best job on my hair she does exactly what i ask for and it always turns out great  she is a pro at everything whether its coloring or cuts everyone at this salon is so nice too and i always walk out happy,4
just 2wks in training with angela and im already noticing weight change and definition havent set foot in a gym over 7yrs and im in love with the training angela helps push me and keeps me motivated and focused this is definitely a lifestyle i want to keep thank you angela,4
ark is ok  ive had better rentals from hertz and also a local company verve  httpwwwvervecarrentalcom  they do cash car rentals in las vegas to like ark does them  there are lots of companies you can book  that are decent it just depends on what you expect and your budget really of course,2
boring small and nothing to say about it slow service no atmosphere food wasnt anything specials not worth going out of your way for,1
st raw berry is divine,4
every single bartender is a rookie not one of them knows the basic ingredients in any common drink they didnt hire these chicks for their brains or abilities,0
fantastic excellent workout super nice friendly staff been going for about 6 weeks each instructor is terrific selling the treadmill,4
amazing spot for libations and delicious cuisine   friendly and knowledgeable staff that is very customer service oriented   a must stop while in downtown phoenix and well worth the drive for the experience,4
great place to have a few cocktails before heading out the solero is awesome the pricing is a little high but hey you pay for what you get highly recommend this place to pregame before heading to youre destination,3
the new location is huge been bringing my dogs to grand paws for a couple years very sweet staff good follow up in and out appointments,4
went for lunch and ok  first beer flat but replace affably and quickly  food ok but best part was anticipation and location  much closer than other stores m,3
horrible service ok burgers good fries overpriced and a la carte ordering burgers and fries separate waitress didnt place our order with the kitchen then offered 15 off after waiting 15 hours for burgers and fries nice patio seating in oakland,1
went there for lunch yesterday food was ok service was lacking server forgot our soup and fries had to ask for them never refilled my tea will not be going back,1
this place will do well because its trendy and modern inside a cool ambiancethe food is just ok the hash browns had way too much salt in them the mushroom spinach scramble was dry and bland huevos rancheros were just ok but hey its probably a hip place to be so food is secondary i guess,2
cupcakes and cake bites are great though the red velvet needs some work while not a selling point for me they have milk on tap to wash the goodies down,4
the cleanest brightest best stocked marshalls this outlet shopper has ever experienced  its quiet and organized inside a big contrast to the ross next door highly recommend if youre on vacay and forgot something at homebig enough to occupy a beat the heat moment from your trek along the strip,4
the crepes taste so good i had the nutella crepe with banana and ice cream it was delicious very clean and friendly staff,4
best place ever happy hour 37 7 days a week musselsclamsoysters on the half shell to die for,4
great place for sandwiches and salads its a little expensive for sandwiches so thats why i only gave it 4 stars but this place is definitely worth the splurge now and again,3
slow slow slow slow slow no point in using the drive thru because you would have taken the same time parking and going inside if you must go great brownies and turkey sandwiches too,1
really good choice for gluten ftee  delicious bread  lots of choices for fixins  just as delicious as when we visited ikes in san francisco,4
traveling from san francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8amnwe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone nvery disappointing,0
had the sushi it was awesome,4
i go here all the time super nice owners most importantly the food is amazing my favorite is the pot stickers and the no 2 spicy noodles with yummy meat the place is cute and clean great service as well,4
not a fannvery slow service and what little attention we did get from the server was not goodnfood was marginal at best pizza was bland and the crust was doughy,0
awesome  you have to do this at night the lights are spectacular and the view is amazing  we were at the very top when the bellagio water show started amazing,3
love love love best smoothies around must try the acai bowls i have tried every single one of them and have never been disappointed they are absolutely delicious i could eat here everyday,4
this was the worst experience ive ever had at a place that calls themselves a bar we went in and tried to to order shots and they told us shots or drinks not both  and the food we ordered tasted like salt and grease,0
great space very dramatic food was really good potstickers were excellent with a crispy crust dynamite chicken was flavorful with the right combination of sweet and spicy  service was great worth trying id go back,3
i had a great dinner here on a night when i had a serious noodle soup craving everyone i went with loved their meal as well the papaya salad is fantastic its full of herbs and a really sweet dressing i might make this my new sunday night dinner spot the atmosphere is also really unique,3
pizza is just about the right size for a quick lunch try the firecracker crust not real spicy but has some taste to it only down side is crust is a little soggy for me not a deal beaker but a little crisp to the bottom would be better  neat idea and pretty tastey all the way around,3
i love this place i come her almost daily on my lunch break great product great customer service and a wealth of knowledge,4
a great service to the phoenix area and an amazingly kind and accommodating staff nnthey make custom engraving an easy process for the everyday consumer nncustomer service is also the best in this citys industry from what i have experienced nnthank you,4
well once again penny came thru like the pro she is brought piewacket in for a bath and major trimming today and my long hair kitty is loving life again she gets really pissy when she needs to be groomed thanks penny love you,4
horrible crooks  these people are con artists and are now impersonating another moving company with good reviews to get clients  please file a complaint online with the attorney general if they have scammed you and damaged your items,0
the skirt steak had so much flavor i wanted more of it  the roasted chicken was delicious with mashed potatoes as well great deal two entrees and a bottle of wine for 49,3
an excellent place for any occasion besides the great entrees grilled artichoke was awesome angelo was on top of his game with excellent service and recommendations,4
walked out before even ordering  they were not busy at all but waitress took forever just to bring drinks  by that time we had changed our mid  very pricey and limited menu  the name american grill can be deceptive  try newport beach overpriced nuevo american but mostly just trendy,1
need a new menu that describes what you are serving people  butter salad was all field greens with a couple pieces of butter lettuce  quinoa and bulgar wheat side dish was mostly arugula with a little quinoa  salmon was served dry and overcooked  i had to cut it with a knife  noisy  came home hungry,0
our first time here very relaxing and service was excellent james and the manager took care of us we enjoyed the food,3
love this placethe food is awesome my boyfriend is cantonese and he said the food is authentic  we go there weekly only flaw is the service da waitresses dont know how to wait tables,3

came here for dinner waiters took a while to get our order and there was not alot people we ordered the theresa and the corn on cob with chili cheese and lime the food tasted fine but i feel like it was overpriced 6 for one corn on a cob with chili and cheese come on now,1
i love this place its a great hang out on the strip they have excellent service and great drinks,4

first time going to this restaurant  the service was great the staff is very friendly  will definitely come back i would recommend this place to anyone,3
customer service is on point nnhot dogs never in a million years would i have thought id be paying 7 for a hotdog but man is it worth it,4
waitress is the best angry dog with pork belly as my boss would say the bomb my girl friend had the beef bulgogi dog shared euro fries def coming back,4
the absolute best property in scottsdale nothing else compares not least of all because of property manager rebecca the best in the business,4
cocktails with friends at 530 live music nice but way too loud more appropriate for late night nalso bewarethere are no bathrooms despite having more than 250 seats nmgt says since they dont serve food they dont need bathrooms  really stupidwont be back,0
running out of gyros on a thursday night  really  extremely disappointing we came for their main dish and they ran out of it,0

this place is clean decorated very cute and the ladies are all friendly and super accommodating ive never had an issue getting in even when its last minute and the prices are fair i get gel overlay and they never disappoint,4
under staffed and under trained staff not your typical oreganos experience staff is rough na chaotic dining experience at best an espoused chicago restaurant and no blackhawks game only ozzie and harriet come on nowcave creek is starving for any dining experience time will tell,0
this place is always busy worth the wait though food is good and the portions are huge you may want to consider sharing a meal they have the best pizza in the area im from chicago and this is the closest ive found so far,3
third time here and each time it is a great experience  atmosphere  is fun and relaxing  a must for a girls pamper day  pedicures and gel manicures are amazing and last for weeks,4
carrie was our waiter and she was great meat was very tasty a little on the dry side but tasty none the less had a rib n pork platter someone else had mac n cheese ribs were tasty and their house bbq sauce was very yummy there may be better bbq places but this place was still delicious none the less,3
yummy yummy yummy the food is fresh has great flavor and is absolutely delicious the owner and her daughter are so friendly and very helpful as this was my first visit but definitely not my last,4
very good dental office  longtime staff  a good sign  front desk friendlynnmost services availablenndr crowley personable and sensitive to patient  no pain  anxiety management very goodnnexcellent hygienistsnni personally have been a patient five years,4
tacos were ok i think they are a little pricey after reading the other reviews i thought i would find the best tacos everbut no i will still keep searching for the best tacos in phx  i still prefer these tacos over most taco places in this city the owners and service was awesome,3
loved the drinks but the service was horrible we ordered an appetizer that never came and was later put on the bill i would rather just sit at the bar than deal with the servers attitude,1
i had the lamb dumplings which were flavorful and i would highly recommend  very friendly service from the staff  and i cherished the more traditional chinese  seaweed served as the salad  ill be coming back just to find this salad,4
i ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasnt what i was expecting but good employees were super friendly and the store was spotless even on a busy saturday evening fun addition to centennial hills,4
was super excited to enjoy shaved snow in my neighborhood but that excitement quickly diminished after one taste  overly priced and not worth the cost  ill continue to drive to china town for some yummy shaved snow,0
amazing salads some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it i would love if they opened earlier around 6 for breakfast i would stop by every day on my way to work,3
we come here ofter i dont recommend the bison burger but i can highly recommend the turkey and the angus burgers i get worried they wont last long since it never seems real busy but the veggies are fresh the have a great balsamic as well as special sauces all wonderful with a good beer cheers,3
worse place ever store is messy and short staff the ladies at the counter cant calculate time 20 mins turned into over 2hrs and still not done i ended up taking my stuff because it wasnt even half way done nndont waste your time,0
cool place to check it out,3
this place is hands down the best place to get your phone fixed i received great customer service and it was a really quick fix   i will definitely recommend this place to everyone if i could i would give 10 stars very satisfied with the work and customer service,4
my hubby and i love the food and staff here and the bakery stuff are awesome small friendly warm restaurant,4
service was good the food taste terrible feels like the boiling pot in la but taste totally different i ordered the spicy pot the super spicy one its not spicy at alldisoppionted,0
my boyfriend reeeeally enjoyed the fried chicken wingsother than that this place was alright,2
prices are fair but 45 minutes to wash and vac my car thats a little much undecided if ill be a returning customer,1
not that good overpriced bad service tables were dirty,0
my favorite im so glad they opened one right by me theyre the best shaved ice ive ever had,4
wait times  yuck  nngreat product but when it comes down to it this location has higher prices by like 1020 longer waits like 40 minutes and not as good service as other locations  the place is really new and big  but i will stick to the mesa location or the power rd location,1
very friendly great service food was good not great  love the mom and pop atmosphere,3
a healthy choice for lunch or dinner in the plaza the dumplings are homemade and are very soft i had the carrot  beef dumplings and they were quite delicious the congee is fairly cheap at 2 a bowl so whenever i have spare change i stop by and grab one give the place a try,3
needed a place to practice hitting otherwise id have found another place not enough room in the slow pitch cage to allow for a full swing thankful i had someone with me to pull the net away definitely not worth 25 for an hour of pitches two stars only because its indoors,1
small and not enough room avoid this place if youre bringing a whole team last resort,0
this cupcake place simply sucks you have to wait to get in but once you taste the cupcakes they are horrible the cake has no flavor and lacks something  the toppings make it appealing until you taste the whole cupcake  i tossed the cupcake i bought for lack of flavor my kids also got rid of theirs,0
maybe i am not fancy enough but it just tasted like a cupcake it was funny to order from an atm i rank it low because it was expensive 450 each and not all that special they are also not big at all for the price i expected it to be a larger cupcake,1
fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man,0
friendly service but food quite ordinary  did not enjoy the food except sou p which was okay,1
first time at this new bbq and i was very pleased with my dinner had the baby back ribs and they were excellent right up there with the best i have had in az the brisket was good but a little dry i will definitely go back soon and try other menu items,3
loved it its free for the ppl who are wondering basically a tuner shop for fords with a extremely nice collection of cobras gts ext with a gift shop and sells center for those looking for some performance upgrades,4
cool restaurant great neighborhood concept but the food is so bland store bought chips for the dips kids mac and cheese is gritty and flavorless chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned heaping pile of raw arugula on my pizza salt is great resource thanks but no thanks not again,1
great atmosphere nice staff a bit pricey for what you get but its all organic and healthy my wife and i love this place,4
such a cool ambiance and clean salon steven gives the best foot massages everid go just for them but they do nails so well you dont have to go as much cause they last a long time but its the best place to go after a night in heels,4
great choice of toppings but bland beef loved the spicy relish and wasabi mayo on the hawaiian burger,1
made 2 appts n waited all afternoon for them then got txts saying they cant make not wasting anymore time on this unreliable service,0
good new place but super busy and unorganized but the meat on the pit stick is amazing a must try they even have the street corn on the cob with mayo,3
well we came back nperfect o this time cristofer the bartender awesome li juego e always ngood food nice people this time,4
love this place the ordering process is less than ideal but the food is amazing if you want mexican but something a little different than the regulartry this place the mole fries are amazing everything is homemade and fresh huge draft beer selection good for picky kids too,4
the guys were very helpful and affordable highly recommend them with any of my i phone or i pad needs,4
service and food are excellent no fluff just straight up great quality every plate that was being served looked and smelled great ni will most definitely be returning to sample the rest of the menu,3
britney clark was fantastic with her services we met her and gave her all the information necessary to serve our partynnwe handed her an oop along with a picture of the person needed to be served and she was able and successful at serving her within 5 minutesnnmoney well spent thank you britney,4
food was bad but the delivery was unbelieveable it took forever and the driver had the audacity to tell me he didnt have change for my order it cost 13 and i had 20 thats a little more than a fifty percent tip for terrible  cold pizza and long wait time never again,0
i   was given the bate and switch routine that sleazy car dealers are known for  and i would never recommend cardinaleway mazda peoria az to anyone,0
avoid dr troung i had a horrible experience here,0
excellent food service and ambiance  everything was super fresh and flavorful the soups are to die for with eastern european flavors spoke to the owner renata very sweet and accommodating and passionate about her new cafe  big plus outside dog friendly patio  nnhighly recommendedntodd and sandra,4
super clean great service 1hookah2people 20 for hookah  30 for all night refills the food looks good but i cant say because i didnt have anything lol but appearance looks good came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that its worth it,4
we are so thrilled to have such a clean modern spot for delicious mexican food in sunneyslope everything was so fresh and plated very nicely friendly clean staff we will be back many times so much to try at a good price,4
everything weve tried has been amazing including the blind special friendly staff great decor one of our favorite places to brunch,4
nice and small family run restaurant with great food you can eat in or they have fast delivery everything we tried has been really good and with enough leftover for another meal,3
the best chinese food i have had in a very long time service is great as well always friendly,4
the cake boss should be ashamed of his store the service was horrible and we never had any cake we waited 45 mins,0
the management doesnt know how to handle large crowds they need a better work flow system waited 15 hours got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli i gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because i didnt want to waste food truly disappointed not worth the wait time or money,0
i was expecting it to be better i got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average ive had better at a supermarket i love cake boss so i was hoping this would be good ill just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods,1
just made it back in to give it another shot i just had to make it on here to say that i had a very nice jimmy johns experience the sandwich had some meat on it the service was great and served up very fast,2
well horrible first visit xoxo dont get a waiter to save our life finally grab someone to some nothing then grab someone else just to be told its not my table  then order drinks they a are the wrong ones and then takes another 20 minutes to get the right ones talked to manager and all taken care of,2
this place is awesome beautiful girls exceptional service and a full fledged party every time ive gone ive been 3 times and plan to go many more,4
just used a groupon for date night and man are we going back service was outstanding food was amazing and drinks were sooooooo good highly recommend the brauts and the beer flight,4
the sandwich filling options are good but the bread is dry crumbly and tastes mass produced with options like milios and jimmy johns so close by with much better bread its hard to justify paying so much for a sandwich here,2

monica has been a saint to my hair i trust her completely wether its a cut or color i always leave completely happy with my hair it is such a fun  environment to be in  ill never go anywhere else,4
ehh not worth my time or  ni rather go to el gordo and get my tacos nnidk about their rice dish but the meat on my tacos is the big thing here  so i would say it aint all that  nnwont come back again im sorrynnthis place takes forever to make my orders and i was not satisfied,0
this ramen was a joke our waitress told us it was top ramen and i guess i had the creamy chicken flavored with what seemed like sliced lunchmeat in it ordered the 13 tonkotsunnthe waitress was not very pleasant after we questioned why they used such poor ingredients will not be returning,0
furniture is ok but customer service and delivery was worst experience nsales rep not educated on theyre own company policies and the worst company i have delt with on resolving a problem ni would drive two hours out of my way not to buy from them  my recommendation is anywhere but here,0
i just had my dog groomed there this morning he has been seeing lis for years i will not have any other groomer touch my bichon baby please check her out she is great she handles him with care and he always comes out looking beautiful,4
loved this and so did my very critical thinking 13 year old would recommend for a group while in charlotte be prepared to think and leave no stone unturned,4
yippee i found the best girls in north phoenix  definitely stop in and see ann tracy or victoria for your holiday nails,4
food is ok environment is awesome service is off as previous review mentioned chashu bun is a must try fried apply pie is special however the waitress is not prompt who wont come to check if water is needed for the entire dinner,2
nfl football on and im listening to casey kasum tip hits from 1978 what is the target demographic this isnt the only time i left due to terrible ambiance ill keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings i hope they will find an identity,0
are there twice while staying at the mirage there was a little bit of a wait the food was delicious i had the biscuits with gravy and the potato hash delicious had pancakes and bacon yummy too  this place will be on my list for the next trip to vegas plus its 24 hours cant beat that,4
greeted and sat right away served hot sliced bread w olive oil heated in a panini press  good service good no recommendations or anything was offered dessert i had the herb crusted  kale salad very good ni think would be a great evening place for an italian date night,3
service was confusing and the menu transition from lunch to dinner was frustrating over all pizza was grand,2
food was excellent it is good for casual sushi but service could be more professional,3
unfortunately everything that my husband and i ordered was unsatisfactory the burnt ends were extremely dry and the crab cakes and chili were terribly bland on a brighter note the sweet tea was delicious,0
great menu options service was hit  miss atmosphere lacked a little bit of energy food was good grits  pork belly was my favorite  quality of food was even better pricey for bbq once management figures it out will be a great place,2
ive been there twicennthe first time the food was good and the service was greatnnthe second time the food was just ok their best dish pork belly  grits was not available and the service was poor,1
lees sandwiches are lees sandwiches iam just excited i dont have to drive all the way to china town to get my viet sandwich fixyay,2
great tacos i had 2 fish and a side of chips and salsa they are street taco sized but filling nonetheless super friendly folks at the counter id go again,3
it was ok the ordering system was a little confusing but i am a smart girl and i figured it out i was looking for a good burger and i found one just the way i wanted it and the onion rings were good its just missing a little personality,2
the meat is bbq less who wants to add sauce to their own bbqnot me it was 3 star worthy the fries  beans were just ok will i return maybe,2
i will give zero star if i can bad service dim sum is just so so rice noodle is the worst i ever have in the restaurantsa few and very very short noodle and 3 fish balls which  taste like the one i buy in any market,0
this is by far the worst experience i have ever had ive always loved bahama bucks and never had a problem but today i ordered ice cream flavored shaved ice and get a cup of ice cream and shaved ice this is ridiculous,0
amazing food from start to finish i wanted some good authentic mexican food so i drive 45 minutes and it was worth it the food was fresh to order with amazing salsa and the service was great we got our food within great timing  i would definitely come back,4
still a total five star place i love buddha even more because they have rockin desserts im so not a sweet person but the ginger buttercream carrot cupcake is amazing na must try as well is their clam chowder yummy nni said it before this place melds flavors like no body else,4
great food the pho dip is amazing and the dragon fries are a must bring your appetite,4
25 worth of trash look at the picture we waited in line for 30 minutes to get nasty hamburgers some lame chicken french fries that were soggy all in the container heres the real show,0
the food wasnt bad but it was incredibly slow service it took forever to place an order and there was no one in line i probably wont be back  i cant stand slow service,1
ive seen matt three times over the past few years expect to laugh a lot he has a way of taking everyday lifelike a trip to walmartand making it hysterical,4
was hoping for a decent mexican restaurant in south chandler but instead got a mexican dennys lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced do have a nice patio and drinks were ok if thats all your looking for  too bad doubt it will last very long take your money elsewhere,1
i was not impressed by this restaurantthe staff was friendly and the food was quick however the ingredients were not anything you couldnt throw together yourself and make at home for the same cost  and personally this pizza lacked all flavor i most likely will not dine here again,0
my fiancu00e9 and i went there last night and loved it the best salmon sashimi i have ever had the rolls were delicious my favorite is the poke roll definitely a place to go back to,4
i mean its nordstrom rack i am ready to be the first one in line friday morningnnill update my review after i check out the vibe merchandise and layout so excited that this is opening near me,3
same story as everybody else waiting in a really long line and only 2 attendants they must not care too much about customer service around here,0
ive made the mistake of renting here twice each time the line was over an hour long life is too short go elsewhere,0
i think ive found a new favorite restaurant the food is very fresh and flavorful atmosphere is quiet and clean service is outstanding the owner is so welcoming that it felt more like i was dining at his home than a restaurant a1,4
tried this place on a sunday afternoon for lunch the staff was very friendly the place was pretty full but not so full that we had to wait for a table order the pulled pork sandwich and it was great food came out quick and the prices are the same as a comparable place will be returning,4
just okcute atmosphere friendly staff but really nothing special about the donuts  i was expecting a lot more i guess,2
im not sure if we just had a bad first impression or not but it seems as though we were wasting dr webers time  we went in for prescription  refills went to the pharmacy to pick them up and they were never faxed so now it seems as though we wasted or time,0
food and service were top notch our server was well informed she made great suggestions and she was friendly the food was full of flavor and fresh i had the carne asada quesadilla and the meat was tender and melted in my mouth all of the people in our party had great things to say about the food,4
wow what a great find visiting from california and came with my family everything was great i had the chinese chicken salad side of fries i split and the nutella milkshake all so good the building is so cool our server was training to we had 2,4
we need a place like this in town seafood is flown in every dayish and the staff is awesome if you can ask for matthew great personality and will help you figure out how to find the meat in a blue crab,3
the waiter was amazing and so was the food the ambiance is really nice very fun and loud very casual dont wear anything nice you will smell like their sauces the food was really great and super interactive i dont suggest the shrimp theyre not that great king crab still has my mouth drooling,3
we have eaten here three times now and the food is decent the only complaint that i have is the size of the containers used to put salsa in when i asked the girl if i could get a larger container she rudely said no,2
had a great dinner just had the cali roll and pot stickers overall the sushi rolls looked very good our server was very nice however they only had two at the time of dinner i will be back for sure,4
we have eaten here a few times the dinner options are great and the garlic knots are awesome we have had issues with wait times but honestly its no worse than any other place the food is good and if the service is on time its worth the wait,3
good sushi the place is located on a very quiet kindda ghetto part of fremont but the sushi is excellent,3
i had a nice time celebrating at the club my only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor if you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor,2
i got pushed here from the flamingo for a night even though its free dont do it pay to go elsewhere  service was terrible check in was forever long and there was no expedite for total reward tiers,0
food was terrible do yourself a favor and head 1 block south to four peaks this place will probably be shut down in 3 months,0
lucky foos has amazing food and the service was superior i would recommend going for their happy hour so you can try many items,3
it was my first time here today and it was extremely delicious the chicken parm pasta is a must try,4
isolution came out to my home in chandler and repaired 2 ipad screens one that i thought was beyond repair  not only were they able to repair they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new  i will be using them to install my tempered screen when i get my new phones and tablets,4
nice shop good music they were able to take me as a walk in perfect price this is now where i will be getting my hair cut from now on,3
when you put the name philly on a cheesesteak place you better be able to back it up  today i found out straight from philly deserves that philly name  look forward to more cheesesteaks in the future,4
this place is the worst  they deserve no stars but yelp wouldnt allow that terrible service  bad food dont go,0
sat at the bar no music or sound on the tvs after i asked for the second time some music was turned on some sort of low sounding reggae i think could barely hear it no food on the happy hour menu 3 cuba libras i enjoyed those didnt sample the food might come back not sure yet,2
perfect shop for unique witty and humorous cards gorgeous stationery beautiful paper goods and various novelties and gifts i appreciate the staff are always helpful and courteous parking can be a pain but once you score a spot you will be delighted to explore all the goodies in the store,3
wow super fun event ate lots of great food drank some great drinks jammed with great tunes and partied with great people thanks to yelp and all the companies in attendance,4
good service and above average bargain pizza the philli cheese steak was quite good  very family friendly,3
got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter it had a great taste but then the bad part came in it was extremely greasy making it inedible coffees was ok but not that good maybe il try their chicken one day as of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts,1
super awesome event they managed to cater to my veggie needs the set up was nice the yelpers were super cool and the moscatohad to be the strongest ever we loved it the first two dishes win the others no so much one person said they could see theyre reflection in the cheese  yikes,2
the dood was delicious and the service was great and the atmosphere was very nice excited to know they will be serving wine soon,4
great chips and salsa food was really good the fish tacos exceptional  we tried them fried and grilled  wish they served a non alcoholic beer   fried ice cream was fine prices are beyond reasonable   we will be back,4
solid platform with good support still learning how to sell it better but i see the value in it i just need my customers too as well,3
i was there this week twiceawesome foodtaste greatand a cool staff great job with this new locationdish that you should try stuffed quinoa avocado yummy,4
had a great night at nacho daddy  first time eating at this restaurant and it didnt disappoint  i enjoyed the spicy shrimp nachos and a raspberry margarita  looking forward to trying their breakfast menu next,4
we just ordered nachos and a burrito for delivery via postmates and were very disappointed by the quality of the food it was average at best and pretty forgettable we wont likely return again,1
seriously this place is amazing this is exactly how food should be made the nachos with pork and prickly pear sauce are incredible,4
stopped in for a quick dinner had the sushi combo 2 for 18 with a spicy tuna rollnfelt it was just alright nothing terrible but i wouldnt want to order it again service was great though,1
i had a bad customer service expensive at first and wrote in with a compliant the director of operations by far fixed it for us we played golf for 2 hours the food was great the service was friendly and fast its not a cheap date but a much better date than dinner  a movie,4
this place is a trip to morocco try the tea and the date shake the bread is awesome the owner is a gracious host and gave us a bunch of stuff to try i love the decorations in the place too a fun trip out,3
service was fast but the burger hotdog and fries were overrated for the expensive priceninn n out  is still my favorite fast food burger and bachi burger is my favorite gourmet burger place in vegas,2
the marvel experience more like i took your money and there is nothing you can do do not go 4d will never happen you will never be immersed in the 3d and 4d nnthe marvel website promised a lot lol if you go do not expect a lot dont expect anything except long lines,0
